## �&#xDCA1;_**Our August Updates: What's New and Improved**_

Lidia Console and Merchant Console got packed with new features and improvements to enhance your feedback and collaboration experience.

### 🚚 Order Cancellation for Admins

Experience a more streamlined and intuitive order management process in our admin console. Console administrators can now directly cancel orders from sellers who generated delivery codes but did not ship the products. This update eliminates the need for operational support, providing admins with the ability to easily manage and intervene in such orders directly from the order details page.

### 🔔More Advanced Notification Center

As part of this enhancement, new marketing notifications have been added, including notifications for newly created coupons and campaigns. Additionally, seller information has been added to stock notifications for greater clarity, and these notifications now link directly to the seller details page for easier access.

There’s More!\
Notification preferences customization: Users will now be able to determine the types of notifications they want to receive.\
Mark as read: Users will be able to get rid of heavy notification flows.

### 📈 Operation Report Refinements

With these refinement, our administrators can now easily track shipping stages and order quantities directly from the report outputs. Three new columns have been added to operational reports for marketplace shipments;

* Tracking number
* Shipment date
* Delivery date

In addition, a new column has been added to display the total order quantity amount (the sum of the quantities of multiple items in the same order.

### 👨‍💼Merchant Onboarding Improvements

Our administrators could add new seller applications through the application page, but these pages did not fully replicate the seller's onboarding experience. With this enhancement, the process has been transformed into a step-by-step onboarding experience, where each stage of the seller application is tracked, and the seller cannot proceed until all requirements are met in the system.

### 📝Feature of Adding Measure and Weight Informations for Delivery

With this update, the shipping creation screens now allow for the entry and editing of desi and kilo per item. These capabilities can be enabled or restricted on a per-seller basis through the merchant details in the console application.
