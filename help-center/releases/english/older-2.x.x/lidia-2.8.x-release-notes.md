### New Features

### 🎯 Invoice Management Enhancements

#### Admins can upload sender-side invoices **Release Date:** 12/08/2025 **Release Number:** <mark style="color:purple;">LC-2.8.1.1 - LMC-2.8.1.1</mark>

Previously, invoices could only be uploaded by sellers. With this enhancement, admins can also upload sender-side return invoices with the related return code. The receiving party can view these invoices uploaded by the admin in the Invoice Center.



#### Filtering invoices by uploader and party information **Release Date:** 12/08/2025 **Release Number:** <mark style="color:purple;">LC-2.8.1.2 - LMC-2.8.1.2</mark>

It is now possible to filter invoices in the list by uploader and invoice party details. With this enhancement, admins can search more accurately and efficiently by considering who uploaded the invoice (e.g., seller, admin) and the related invoice party.



#### **Displaying source information of uploaded invoices in listings** **Release Date:** 12/08/2025 **Release Number:** <mark style="color:purple;">LC-2.8.1.3</mark>

Invoice listing screens now include information about the source area (e.g., order, return) from which the invoice was uploaded. This allows users to directly access invoice source details and more easily validate records.





### 🎯 Reporting Enhancements

#### Withholding collection report accessible to admins **Release Date:** 12/08/2025 **Release Number:** <mark style="color:purple;">LC-2.8.1.4</mark>

Admins can now directly access reports under the “Reports” section that provide both a summary of sellers’ withholding collection data and a detailed view of all withholding deductions across the platform.





### 🎯 Payment **Management** Enhancements

#### Defining down payment conditions in payment rules **Release Date: 12/08/2025** **Release Number:** <mark style="color:purple;">LC-2.8.1.5</mark>

Previously, payment rules could be defined based on conditions such as category, brand, seller, or price. With this enhancement, admins can also define a down payment amount as a rule condition. This allows requiring a certain amount to be collected upfront for orders.





### 🎯 Security Enhancements

#### Activation of two-factor authentication **Release Date: 12/08/2025** **Release Number:** <mark style="color:purple;">LP-2.8.1.1</mark>

In Lidia PIM, SMS-based two-factor authentication (MFA) has been activated to strengthen login security. After entering their username and password, users will be required to enter a one-time verification code sent to their mobile phone before accessing the system.





### Improvements

### 💡 **User Experience Enhancements**

#### Sorting content by newest first **Release date :** 12/08/2025 **Version number :** <mark style="color:purple;">LC-2.8.1.6</mark>

The default sorting logic of content lists has been updated so that the most recent content appears at the top. This ensures users can access the latest data more quickly.
