#### Filtering invoices by uploader and party information **Release Date:** 12/08/2025 **Release Number:** <mark style="color:purple;">LC-2.8.1.2 - LMC-2.8.1.2</mark>

It is now possible to filter invoices in the list by uploader and invoice party details. With this enhancement, admins can search more accurately and efficiently by considering who uploaded the invoice (e.g., seller, admin) and the related invoice party.



#### **Displaying source information of uploaded invoices in listings** **Release Date:** 12/08/2025 **Release Number:** <mark style="color:purple;">LC-2.8.1.3</mark>

Invoice listing screens now include information about the source area (e.g., order, return) from which the invoice was uploaded. This allows users to directly access invoice source details and more easily validate records.
