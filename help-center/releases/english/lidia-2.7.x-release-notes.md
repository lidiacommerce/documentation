### ðŸŽ¯ Finance Management Enhancements

#### **Ability to define commission rates by payment method** **Release Date:** 26/06/2025 **Release Number:** <mark style="color:purple;">LC-2.6.1.1</mark>

Commission rates could previously be configured by criteria such as category, brand, or seller, but could not be differentiated by payment method. With this enhancement, sellers can now define distinct commission rates based on the selected payment method.



#### **Standardizing the reference code format in payout breakdowns** **Release Date:** 26/06/2025 **Release Number:** <mark style="color:purple;">LC-2.6.1.2</mark>

The reference code displayed in the payout breakdowns was previously shown in an inconsistent and hard-to-read format. With this enhancement, the reference code has been standardized to improve clarity and consistency.



### ðŸŽ¯ Reporting Enhancements

#### **Adding trade name information to operational reports** **Release Date:** 26/06/2025 **Release Number:** <mark style="color:purple;">LC-2.6.1.3</mark>

Operational reports previously did not include trade name information for sellers. With this enhancement, trade names have been added to report outputs, allowing users to distinguish and analyze seller data more easily.



#### **Logging login activity as part of audit logs** **Release Date:** 26/06/2025 **Release Number:** <mark style="color:purple;">LP-2.6.1.1</mark>

Login activity in the PIM module was previously tracked in a limited capacity. With this enhancement, login events are now comprehensively recorded as part of the systemâ€™s audit log structure.

#### Enhancing delivery details and adding tracking redirection in order detail view **Release date :** 26/06/2025 **Version number :** <mark style="color:purple;">LC-2.6.1.4</mark>
