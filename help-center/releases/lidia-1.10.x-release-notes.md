### üöÄ **Bug Fixes and Functional Improvements**&#x20;

* <mark style="color:blue;">**LC-102402-01-**</mark>**Empty Record Improvements:** Previously, when there was no order record, the page would simply load without any indication. With this update, users are now notified when no record exists, making the page clearer.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**LC-102402-03-**</mark>**Commission Management Page Enhancements:** Previously, there were separate pages for commission rates and rules, causing confusion for users wanting to add commission rules. This update removes the old commission rate page and provides a clearer navigation.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**LMC-102401-01-**</mark>**Delivery Management Bug Fixes and Notifications:** Missing visuals and notification adjustments have been made on delivery and order pages, with corrections for listing and redirection errors.

### üõç Order Management Enhancements

* <mark style="color:blue;">**LC-102401-01-**</mark>**Order Listing View:** The order listing page has been updated to a new design, enhancing page performance and user experience.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**LC-102401-02-**</mark>**Undelivered and Returned Shipments:** In cases where a delivery cannot reach the recipient, the return process to the sender is now fully traceable in the console. When a package is returned to the sender after a failed delivery attempt, refunds to the buyer are now supported, ensuring clear tracking and updates throughout the delivery process.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**LC-102402-02-**</mark>**Cancellations with Integrated Service Providers:** Administrators were able to cancel unshipped deliveries, but the cancellation information was not communicated to marketplace-integrated service providers. Now, admins can cancel shipments that sellers are unable to fulfill directly from the order details, ensuring synchronization with service providers.
* <mark style="color:blue;">**LC-102402-06-**</mark>**Order Status Filtering Enhancements:** Draft orders were listed among regular orders, causing confusion. With this update, the "draft" status has been removed from the order status filters to improve clarity.

***

### üìë Invoice Management

*   <mark style="color:blue;">**LC-102401-03-**</mark> **Uploaded Invoice Details:** The information for uploaded invoices in order details has been updated to include invoice type, invoice number, and order reference number, instead of relying on limited address and tax ID fields.\


    ***

### üìÅ Catalog Mangement Enchancements

* <mark style="color:blue;">**LC-102402-04-**</mark>**New Rejection Reasons:** Console administrators can now reject products sent for approval by sellers using 11 different reasons (an addition of 4 new options). Additionally, the reason previously labeled as "incorrect category" has been updated to "category information missing/incorrect."
* <mark style="color:blue;">**LC-102402-05-**</mark>**Category Data Schema Modification Restriction Based on Pool Content:** Previously, there was no restriction on modifying the category data schema based on pool content status. Now, if no items have been added to a pool, the schema can be changed; if items are present, the schema cannot be altered.

### üõí Vendor Management Enhancements

* <mark style="color:blue;">**LMC-102402-01-**</mark>**Merchant Application Process Enhancements:** Information and navigation have been enhanced for users applying to become merchant.
