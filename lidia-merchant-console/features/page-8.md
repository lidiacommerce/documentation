# Inventory Management

Effective inventory management is crucial for businesses to fulfill customer demand. Upon the arrival of goods, inventory management involves receiving, counting, sorting, and organizing stock in an efficient manner.

Having the appropriate inventory management system is vital in preventing the unnecessary storage of surplus inventory, which can lower holding costs. Tracking inventory can be a tedious process if lacking automated and efficient inventory control software.

1. Stores
2. Warehouses&#x20;
