## Introduction

Product information management (PIM) software is utilized by companies to gather, organize, and handle product information, including data such as product descriptions, features, specifications, images, videos, pricing, and availability.

The following outlines the manner in which PIM software functions within an organization:

* Changes made by the engineering team to an existing product are added to the central PIM system.
* The central PIM system overwrites or updates the current product information and makes it accessible to all other teams.
* Upon reviewing these changes, the product management team adjusts the product's price in accordance with the modifications made by the engineering team in the PIM system, and the PIM system then automatically updates the price on all distribution channels.
* The E-commerce team can access the updated information from the central PIM system without concerns about its accuracy, and then update the product description in the PIM system. The PIM system then automatically updates the product description on all distribution channels.\
