# Features



Product Information Management (PIM) refers to the process of centralizing and managing product information in a structured and organized manner to ensure consistency and accuracy across all channels. The three main features of PIM are:

1. **Product data acquisition and enrichment:** This feature involves acquiring product data from various sources and enriching it with additional information such as descriptions, images, videos, specifications, and pricing. This process ensures that the product data is complete, accurate, and consistent.
2. **Product Inclusion:** means making product information accessible, understandable, and relevant to a diverse range of users, including those with disabilities and different preferences. This can be achieved by using clear language, providing information in multiple formats and languages, and incorporating accessibility features. It helps companies create a more inclusive customer experience and increase their market reach.
3. **Data Feeding:** Product data feeding in PIM involves importing, exporting, and synchronizing product information between the PIM system and other systems or channels. It ensures that product data is up-to-date and consistent across all channels, improving the customer experience.
