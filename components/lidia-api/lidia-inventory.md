## Concepts

### **SKUs (Stock Keeping Units)**

A **SKU** represents an individual product variant in your inventory. SKUs are used to manage stock levels, pricing, and availability for each product across multiple locations. **Lidia Inventory** allows you to create and manage SKUs to ensure accurate tracking of all products in your catalog.

### **Stock Management**

**Lidia Inventory** provides powerful stock management features, allowing you to track and update stock levels in real-time. You can manage inventory across multiple locations, ensuring that stock is correctly allocated and visible to customers, reducing the chances of overselling.

### **Price Management**

With **Lidia Inventory**, you can set and update prices for each product variant (SKU) across different sales channels. This flexibility ensures that price changes are reflected in real-time, whether due to promotions, discounts, or regional pricing variations.
