# User Roles & Permissions

## 1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

This feature allows administrators to assign different access levels to users based on their roles within the organization. It ensures that team members only have access to the tools, data, and features they need to perform their job. Key aspects of RBAC include:

* **Predefined Roles**: Common roles like Admin, Editor, and Viewer come with predefined permissions that map to standard team functions.
  * **Admin**: Full access, including user management, settings, and reporting.
  * **Editor**: Can modify content, manage products, and make operational changes but without administrative privileges.
  * **Viewer**: Read-only access, suitable for stakeholders who need insights but should not alter any data or settings.
* **Permission Layers**: Access can be segmented into different layers such as product management, sales, content, or customer data, ensuring specific users are limited to the areas relevant to them.

## **2. Customizable User Roles**

Customizable roles allow organizations to tailor the permissions structure to their unique workflows. For example, you can create a role like “Logistics Manager” with specific permissions tied to managing inventory, shipments, and supplier relations. Features include:

* **Granular Permission Settings**: Define permissions for viewing, editing, or deleting items. For instance, a user can be allowed to view orders but not modify them.
* **Custom Workflows**: Roles can be designed around specific business processes, such as allowing access to the product catalog but restricting access to financial or customer data.
* **Role Templates**: Save custom roles as templates to be applied across multiple teams or projects, speeding up user onboarding.

## **3. Audit Trail**

The audit trail feature ensures accountability and transparency by tracking every action made within the platform. This means administrators can:

* **Track Changes**: View a record of actions taken by each user, including edits to products, changes to settings, or modifications to permissions.
* **User Accountability**: Identify who made specific changes and when they were made, helping ensure responsible use of the system.
* **Comprehensive Logs**: Logs can be filtered by user, date, or specific actions (e.g., product updates or order management), providing a detailed view for compliance and security purposes.
* **Security and Compliance**: The audit trail also serves as a vital tool for regulatory compliance, ensuring the business can demonstrate secure and controlled access to sensitive data.
