# Features

The feature guides provide in-depth information about the features, including their practical uses, advantages for businesses, and real-world applications.

This information can be valuable for individuals such as **business owners**, **product owners**, or **developers**.

With the Lidia Console, which has an easy menu, you can manage the system, catalogs, contents and many other elements related to your site. Here are a few steps to help you do this:&#x20;

1. **Create your app on Lidia**&#x20;

When you log in to the Lidia console with the e-mail and password you received with the service you receive, the main page welcomes you. You can create a web application, mobile application or desktop application depending on your preference with the add new application button on the home page.
