# Invoice Center

The Invoice Center is the area where invoices uploaded by sellers after completed transactions on the marketplace are centrally displayed, reviewed, and managed. Through this section, the accuracy of uploaded invoices is checked, approval or rejection processes are carried out, and invoices can be re-evaluated when necessary. Additionally, as a Console admin, you can manually upload invoices on behalf of sellers from this area. The Invoice Center serves as a critical control point that supports transparent, traceable, and compliant management of financial processes.

## Invoices

The Invoices page is the main screen under the Invoice Center where all invoice records are listed. On this page, invoices are grouped under four main headings: All, which lists all invoices in the system; Pending Invoices, which shows invoices awaiting approval or rejection; Approved Invoices, which includes accepted invoices; and Rejected Invoices, which displays invoices that have been rejected. This structure allows invoice statuses to be tracked quickly and clearly.

Using the Export Data button located in the upper right corner of the page, selected invoices or all invoices in the relevant lists can be exported in Excel format. This feature facilitates reporting, archiving, and data sharing for accounting processes. Next to this button, the Add Invoice button allows manual invoice entry. During the invoice upload process, the invoice number, invoice party, invoice date, invoice type, invoice scope, and return code information are entered, and the process is completed by uploading the invoice document in PDF format.

On the All screen of the Invoices page, all uploaded invoices are listed on a row basis. The list displays the user who uploaded the invoice, the invoice party indicating who issued the invoice to whom, the invoice type, the related transaction (order, delivery, or return), the invoice date, and the invoice status. The list can be filtered by invoice type (individual or corporate), invoice scope (order, delivery, return), invoice party, and invoice status. Invoice party options include:\
Seller → Platform, Seller → Buyer, Platform → Seller, Platform → Buyer, Buyer → Seller, and Buyer → Platform.\
Invoice statuses are represented as pending, approved, valid, or rejected.

For invoices with a pending status, Approve / Reject actions are available next to the detail button. At this stage, the invoice can be approved or rejected by selecting a rejection reason. Rejection reasons are chosen from predefined options such as incorrect party selection, incorrect invoice type or scope, or an invalid file. For invoices with approved or rejected status, a Re-evaluate button is available in the detail view. This allows an approved invoice to be rejected by selecting a rejection reason or a previously rejected invoice to be re-evaluated and accepted. For invoices with a valid status, a Re-upload Invoice button is displayed, enabling the information entered during the invoice upload process to be edited.

By clicking the detail button for any listed invoice, the uploaded e-invoice document can be accessed directly in PDF format. This structure ensures that invoice processes are managed end to end under full control, enabling effective auditing and financial verification processes.
