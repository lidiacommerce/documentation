# Customers

Regardless of whether they have made a purchase or not, every individual who has created a registration on the platform is considered a customer. The Customers section is the area where all users registered on the platform are centrally managed. Through this section, customers can be listed, their basic information can be viewed, order and payment histories can be tracked, campaigns and coupons they have benefited from can be reviewed, the permissions they granted during registration can be viewed, and referral code definitions can be created.

The Customers module is designed to monitor customer behavior, enable customer segmentation, and support end-to-end analysis of the customer experience.

## **Customer Management**

When entering the Customer Management page, users are first presented with the Customer List screen. On this screen, all customers registered in the system are listed, and for each customer, name and email address, segment information, order count, total order amount, membership date, and active/passive status can be viewed in a single overview. A new customer can also be manually created in the system using the **Add New Customer** button located in the upper-right corner of the page.

### **Customer Details**

When navigating to the customer detail screen, a total of eight main sections are available where customer information and behaviors can be monitored. In the summary area located at the top of these sections, key indicators such as the customer’s name, membership date, last visit date, last order date, total number of orders, total amount spent, and current wallet balance are displayed in real time. This summary area provides a quick overview of customer behavior and facilitates navigation to detailed sections.

#### **1. Basic Information**

This screen displays the basic information entered by the customer during registration. Details such as first and last name, gender, email address, phone number, and account activity status can be viewed and edited depending on user authorization.

#### **2. Addresses**

The Addresses screen is where customer address information is managed. In this section, Delivery Addresses, Corporate Invoice Addresses, and Individual Invoice Addresses are displayed in separate areas. Existing addresses can be edited, or new addresses can be added.

#### **3. Orders**

On the Orders screen, the customer’s entire order history is listed. For each order, information such as order number, product quantity, order date, order amount, payment method used, and order status is displayed.

When clicking on the details of any listed order, the user is redirected to the relevant order detail screen under **Sales > Orders** in the left menu.

#### **7. Permissions**

The Permissions screen is where all permissions approved by the customer during marketplace login and usage processes are displayed and managed. On this screen, the customer’s accepted legal permissions, notification permissions, and other mandatory or approval-based preferences can be monitored in detail. Permissions can be filtered and analyzed based on their current status. The permission contents displayed in this section are sourced from the documents uploaded under **Settings > Legal Documents** and referenced by the system. This structure ensures that customer permissions are managed centrally, traceably, and in compliance with legal requirements.
