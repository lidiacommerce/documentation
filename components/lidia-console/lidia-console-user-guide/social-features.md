# Social Features

Social Features is the area where social capabilities aimed at increasing user interaction and enriching the customer experience across the marketplace are managed. Under this section, shopping lists and collections created by customers, product reviews and ratings, as well as evaluations of the sellers they have shopped from, are monitored from a single center. The Social Features section supports tracking user behavior, analyzing customer feedback, and continuously improving the overall platform experience.

### **User Lists**

The User Lists section is the area that allows the management and display of the custom lists created by customers during their shopping experience on the marketplace through a single screen. Customers create these lists via the marketplace interface, and each list is displayed in the console with a unique list ID and the custom list name defined by the customer.

These custom lists may include products that customers have selected to purchase later, lists consisting of liked or favorite products, or any personalized collections created by freely adding products according to their preferences. In this way, customers can organize their shopping journey based on their own needs and track products more easily.

User Lists can be managed not only by customers but also by Console administrators. Using the Add New List button located in the upper-right corner of the page, a console admin can manually create a custom list in the system by entering the list name and list code. This capability supports the creation of special lists for campaign, segmentation, or operational purposes.

Various management actions can be performed on the created lists. The console admin can delete lists, navigate to the list detail page to edit basic information such as the list name and list code, and view the products added to the list by the customer. Additionally, products can be removed from the list or new products can be added to the list by the admin when necessary. With this structure, user lists serve as an effective tool that both enriches the customer experience and provides flexibility from a platform management perspective.

#### Ratings and Reviews&#x20;

The Reviews and Ratings section is the central area where evaluations made by customers after their shopping experiences are collected and managed. Through this section, feedback provided about products, order processes, and sellers can be monitored within a single structure, customer satisfaction can be analyzed, and maintaining overall quality standards across the platform is supported. Customer reviews are categorized according to defined criteria and addressed in detail under the relevant subheadings.
