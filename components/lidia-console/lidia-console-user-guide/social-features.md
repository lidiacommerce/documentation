# Social Features

**Social Features** is the area where social capabilities aimed at increasing user interaction and enriching the customer experience across the marketplace are managed. Under this section, shopping lists and collections created by customers, product reviews and ratings, as well as evaluations of the sellers they have shopped from, are monitored from a single center. The Social Features section supports tracking user behavior, analyzing customer feedback, and continuously improving the overall platform experience.
