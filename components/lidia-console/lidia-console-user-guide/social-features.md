# Social Features

Social Features is the area where social capabilities aimed at increasing user interaction and enriching the customer experience across the marketplace are managed. Under this section, shopping lists and collections created by customers, product reviews and ratings, as well as evaluations of the sellers they have shopped from, are monitored from a single center. The Social Features section supports tracking user behavior, analyzing customer feedback, and continuously improving the overall platform experience.

### **User Lists**

The User Lists section is the area that allows the management and display of the custom lists created by customers during their shopping experience on the marketplace through a single screen. Customers create these lists via the marketplace interface, and each list is displayed in the console with a unique list ID and the custom list name defined by the customer.

These custom lists may include products that customers have selected to purchase later, lists consisting of liked or favorite products, or any personalized collections created by freely adding products according to their preferences. In this way, customers can organize their shopping journey based on their own needs and track products more easily.

User Lists can be managed not only by customers but also by Console administrators. Using the Add New List button located in the upper-right corner of the page, a console admin can manually create a custom list in the system by entering the list name and list code. This capability supports the creation of special lists for campaign, segmentation, or operational purposes.

Various management actions can be performed on the created lists. The console admin can delete lists, navigate to the list detail page to edit basic information such as the list name and list code, and view the products added to the list by the customer. Additionally, products can be removed from the list or new products can be added to the list by the admin when necessary. With this structure, user lists serve as an effective tool that both enriches the customer experience and provides flexibility from a platform management perspective.

### Ratings and Reviews&#x20;

The Ratings and Reviews section is the central area where evaluations made by customers after their shopping experiences are collected and managed. Through this section, feedback provided about products, order processes, and sellers can be monitored within a single structure, customer satisfaction can be analyzed, and maintaining overall quality standards across the platform is supported. Customer reviews are categorized according to defined criteria and addressed in detail under the relevant subheadings.

* #### **Product Reviews**

The Product Reviews page is the area where customer reviews and ratings for products are reviewed through the admin approval process. When entering the page, product reviews that have been submitted by customers and are awaiting admin approval are first listed under the Review Requests heading. In this list, product information, seller information, and review details are displayed, and each request includes a Finalize Request button. Through this button, the review detail screen opens, where the customer’s star rating (out of 5), written comment, and the review’s date and time are shown. From this screen, the admin can approve the review or reject it by selecting an appropriate rejection reason. Approved or rejected reviews are listed under the Product Reviews section, and each review includes a status label along with a Re-evaluate button. This allows a previously approved review to be rejected or a rejected review to be moved to an approved status. Reviews listed under this section are synchronized live to the marketplace, and the lists can be exported in Excel format using the Export Data button located at the top right of the page.

* #### **Order Reviews**

The Order Reviews page is the area where customer ratings and comments regarding completed orders are managed. When entering the page, order reviews that have been submitted by customers and are awaiting admin approval are listed under the Review Requests heading. The screen structure, workflow, and review process on this page operate in the same way as product reviews. The admin can review the order-related feedback, approve the review, or reject it by specifying a rejection reason. Additionally, previously approved or rejected reviews can be reprocessed through the Re-evaluate button. Approved order reviews are published on the marketplace, making the customer experience visible.

* #### **Seller Reviews**

The Seller Reviews page is the area where ratings and comments given by customers to sellers they have shopped from are reviewed and managed. On this page, seller reviews that have been submitted by customers and are awaiting the admin approval process are listed under the Review Requests heading. The screen structure and review workflow are identical to those of product and order reviews. The admin can review the rating and comment given to the seller, approve the review to publish it on the marketplace, or reject it by specifying a rejection reason. Previously finalized reviews can be taken back into the review process using the Re-evaluate button. Approved seller reviews enable transparent monitoring of seller performance and support a sense of reliability across the marketplace.
