# After-Sales

The After Sales section is the central area where cancellation and return requests related to orders placed on the marketplace are managed and tracked. All cancellation and return requests created by customers or operational processes are collected under this module. Through this section, requests can be monitored end-to-end, evaluated by being associated with the relevant orders and deliveries, and after-sales processes can be managed in a controlled, transparent, and traceable manner.
