# After-Sales

The After Sales section is the central area where cancellation and return requests related to orders placed on the marketplace are managed and tracked. All cancellation and return requests created by customers or operational processes are collected under this module. Through this section, requests can be monitored end-to-end, evaluated by being associated with the relevant orders and deliveries, and after-sales processes can be managed in a controlled, transparent, and traceable manner.

## Returns

The Returns section is the central area where all orders with an initiated return request on the marketplace are listed, reviewed, and managed. Under this heading, return requests initiated by customers or sellers can be tracked end to end, and the status of each request can be viewed in detail. This section enables return processes to be managed in a transparent, traceable, and controlled manner.

On the Returns page, all orders with an open return request are displayed in a list format. For each request, the return request number, the related order amount (in TL), and the date the return request was created are shown. The list can be filtered by date, by request status, and by the minimum–maximum TL range of the order amount. Return request statuses are classified as New, In Progress, Completed, Accepted, Withdrawn, and Rejected. This filtering structure allows operational teams to easily distinguish between ongoing and completed return processes.

When you navigate to the details of any listed request, the #XXXXX Request Detail header appears at the top of the page, displaying summary information related to the return request. First, the Summary Template is shown. This template includes the customer’s full name, phone number and email address, the order date and time, the order amount, the related seller store information, the order number, and the order reference number. By clicking on the seller store name, you are redirected to the relevant seller’s store screen within the Seller List page under the [Sellers](sellers.md) section in the Console’s left menu.

Below the summary template is the Request Information template. This area displays the request ID, the party that initiated the process (buyer or seller), the request status, the transaction amount, the request type, sub-reason, and description fields in detail. These details clearly define the reason for the return request and its scope.

Under the Request Information template, the Products Related to the Request template is displayed. The content of this area varies depending on the status of the return request.

* When the request status is New, this template shows only the relevant product or products, quantity information, and amount details.
* When the request status is In Progress, information indicating that a shipment code has been created, along with the date–time details and the carrier name, is displayed. At this stage, the sender must confirm receipt of the products. If the products have not yet been received by the seller, a warning stating “The sender has not yet confirmed receipt of the products” appears on the screen. At this point, the Console admin has the authority to approve or reject return requests for the selected product or products.
* When the request status is Completed, the template displays confirmation information indicating that the request has been approved, along with the date and time, shipment type, approval reason, and description details.
* When the request status is Rejected, the template shows the “Request rejected” information together with the rejection date and time, rejection reason, and description details.

On the right side of the return request detail screen, the Request Movements template is displayed. This template presents the lifecycle of the return request step by step in chronological order. All actions taken throughout the process are recorded here. A sample request flow consists of the steps Process Started, Process Updated, Approved, and Completed. This structure makes it easy to track the current stage of the return process and review all actions taken previously.

The Returns section plays a critical role in ensuring the smooth execution of after-sales operations, maintaining customer satisfaction, and managing return processes under a standardized structure.
