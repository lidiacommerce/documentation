# Inventory

The Inventory section is the area where all products with defined price and stock information in the system are centrally tracked. Through this section, the product inventory of all sellers operating on the marketplace can be monitored, and warehouse definitions required for sellers to create deliveries using marketplace-contracted logistics providers can be managed. The Inventory module enables stock, pricing, and operational statuses of products to be controlled under a single structure.

The Inventory section consists of two main headings: **Warehouses** and **Inventory**.



* ### **Warehouses**

On the Warehouses page, a list of all warehouses defined by sellers is displayed. As previously mentioned in the seller detail screens under the [Sellers](sellers.md) section in the Console left menu, warehouse definitions are made at the bottom of the Basic Information section for each seller. The primary purpose of defining warehouses is to ensure that the system knows from which outbound warehouse the goods will be shipped, in accordance with the general rules created by shipping profiles.

On this page, a new warehouse can be defined using the **Add New Warehouse** button located in the upper-right corner by entering the warehouse name, warehouse code, and warehouse status information. In addition, the name, code, and status information of listed warehouses can be updated, and warehouses can be deleted when necessary. This structure allows sellers’ logistics processes to be managed in a more controlled and traceable manner.

* ### **Inventory**

On the Inventory page, all products in the system are displayed in a single, consolidated list. This list allows users to track the overall status of the marketplace product inventory. The inventory table includes the following columns:

Product Name, Barcode Code, Seller Unique Code, Trade Name, Store, Brand, Categories, Product Type, Group Code, Stock Status, Price, Commission Rate, and Active/Passive status.

All columns in the list are filterable, making it easy to analyze products based on different criteria. By clicking on any product listed under the Product Name column, the user is redirected to the Variants page under the [Catalog](product-management.md) section in the Console left menu, where detailed information about the selected product can be accessed.

Using the **Export Data to Excel** button located in the upper-right corner of the Inventory page, selected rows from the table or the entire inventory dataset can be exported as an Excel document. This feature enables easy sharing of inventory data for reporting, analysis, and operational tracking purposes.
