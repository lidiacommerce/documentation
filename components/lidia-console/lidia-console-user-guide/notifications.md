# Notifications

The Lidia Marketplace Console Notification Center is the area where notifications related to all actions performed on the platform are tracked and where users are informed about real-time updates. Notifications can be filtered by notification type and date. Users can mark all notifications as read to clear existing alerts. They may also choose to view only unread notifications if desired.

When a notification is clicked, the user is redirected to the relevant Console page associated with the notification’s category. For example, when the “A new order has been created” notification is selected, the user is redirected to the related order detail page under the **Orders** page within the **Sales** section in the left navigation menu, based on the corresponding order number.

### **Notification Settings**

The Notification Settings page is where users can customize which actions they want to receive notifications for. After customization, users will receive notifications only for the selected action types. Notification preferences are personal and are managed independently of the organization.
