# Logistics

The Logistics section is the central area where all delivery processes across the marketplace are monitored and analyzed end to end. Through this section, it is possible to track in detail which deliveries belong to which orders, which seller shipped them, which cargo company was used, and on which date and from which location the shipment was made. At the same time, information such as the customer associated with the delivery, delivery address, city–district details, the product contents of the shipment, and the current delivery status can be viewed within a single unified structure.

The Logistics module aims to provide transparency, ensure operational visibility, and enable the monitoring of delivery performance. In this way, marketplace administrators can centrally track delivery processes, identify potential delays or issues at an early stage, and carry out reporting and analysis activities in a reliable and structured manner.

## Deliveries

The Deliveries page is a section under the Logistics module where all marketplace deliveries are listed in detail and can be filtered. Through this page, key delivery information is displayed, the current stage of each delivery can be monitored, and the overall status of delivery processes can be followed from an operational perspective.
