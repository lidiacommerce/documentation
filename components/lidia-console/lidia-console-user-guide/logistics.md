# Logistics

The Logistics section is the central area where all delivery processes across the marketplace are monitored and analyzed end to end. Through this section, it is possible to track in detail which deliveries belong to which orders, which seller shipped them, which cargo company was used, and on which date and from which location the shipment was made. At the same time, information such as the customer associated with the delivery, delivery address, city–district details, the product contents of the shipment, and the current delivery status can be viewed within a single unified structure.

The Logistics module aims to provide transparency, ensure operational visibility, and enable the monitoring of delivery performance. In this way, marketplace administrators can centrally track delivery processes, identify potential delays or issues at an early stage, and carry out reporting and analysis activities in a reliable and structured manner.

## Deliveries

The Deliveries page is a section under the Logistics module where all marketplace deliveries are listed in detail and can be filtered. Through this page, key delivery information is displayed, the current stage of each delivery can be monitored, and the overall status of delivery processes can be followed from an operational perspective.

When this page is accessed, users are presented with a comprehensive list containing operational information related to deliveries. The list includes the following columns respectively: Order Date, Sender Name, Reference No, Courier Company, Tracking Code, Delivery Code, Shipment Date, Delivery Date to Recipient, Recipient, City / District, Delivery Content, and Order Status. This structure allows all key details of each delivery to be monitored from a single screen.

Using the Export Data button located in the upper right corner of the page, deliveries listed on the screen—either selected ones or the entire list—can be exported in Excel format. This feature provides operational convenience for reporting, archiving, or sharing delivery data with different teams.

Each delivery listed on the Deliveries page includes two action buttons. The first button directs the user to the Delivery Detail page of the related delivery. The second button opens a modal window that allows quick access to key information about the delivery’s shipping process. This modal particularly presents the Delivery Code, Shipment Tracking Number, Recipient, and Sender information in a summarized view. At the bottom of the modal, the View Details button is available, which redirects the user to the same delivery detail page opened by the first button, enabling quick navigation between screens.

The Delivery No represents the internal system record of the delivery, whereas the Shipment Tracking No is used to track the physical movements of the shipment on the courier company’s side. The shipment tracking number can be queried via the courier company’s website or integration, allowing the logistics process to be monitored through this identifier.

When navigating to the delivery detail page, the upper section displays the courier company performing the delivery along with the delivery code. If the seller has selected the option to deliver the shipment personally, a delivery number is not generated and this field remains empty. Once the delivery is integrated with the courier company, a Track Shipment button appears in the upper right corner of the screen. This button directs the user to the shipment inquiry page of the relevant courier company.

The first main section on the delivery detail page is the Summary Template. This template displays the customer name, order date, delivery amount (TRY), order number, order reference number, and delivery status. Delivery status may be shown in different states such as delivery code created, handed over to the sender, in delivery process, or delivered. This section enables quick assessment of the current state of the delivery.

Below the summary template, the Delivery Information template presents the recipient’s name and address along with the sender’s name and address. This information clearly shows from where and to where the delivery is being routed.

The next section, the Delivery Content template, displays details of the products included in the shipment. This area lists product name, quantity, product price, applied discount amount, and total amount. In this way, both the financial and product-based contents of the delivery can be viewed on a single screen.

On the right side of the delivery detail page, the Delivery Movements template is displayed. This section presents the main logistics events provided by the courier company step by step in chronological order. Each movement is shown together with location and date–time information. Examples include Shipment Collected, Shipment Loaded onto Vehicle, and Shipment Unloaded from Vehicle. This structure allows users to clearly track the current stage of the delivery process and analyze delivery performance.

This comprehensive structure enables delivery processes on the marketplace to be monitored in a transparent, traceable, and analyzable manner.
