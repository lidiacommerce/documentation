## Authorization

The Authorization section includes the pages where user roles and permissions are defined and managed within the Lidia Console. In the Lidia Marketplace system, authorization is designed around a role-based approach rather than a user-based structure. This model enables centralized control and management of users’ access levels and permitted actions through assigned roles. The Authorization section consists of two main areas: Roles and Users.

*   ### **Roles**

    Under the Roles section, the predefined roles provided by Lidia are displayed under **Lidia Roles**. These roles are configured to cover the platform’s standard usage scenarios. In addition, organization-specific roles can be created, existing roles can be deleted, and users assigned to a role can be viewed through the role detail screen. For each role, permissions can be configured across all system modules and capabilities.

    Roles can be configured with the following permission levels:

    * View permission
    * Edit permission
    * Both view and edit permissions

    Roles created later represent customized permission sets tailored to the specific needs of the project and the organization. These roles are referenced across the system to enforce authorization consistently.
*   ### **Users**

    Under the Users section, a list of all registered users in the system is displayed. From this list, you can view each user’s first and last name, email address, assigned roles, system registration date, and user status (Active / Passive). By using the **Create New User** button located in the upper-right corner, a new member can be created by entering the following information:

    * First name
    * Last name
    * Password
    * Email address
    * Phone number
    * Date of birth
    * Role

    By accessing an individual user’s detail page, you can view basic user information such as first and last name, email address, phone number, and date of birth, as well as role and permission details.

Depending on the user’s assigned permissions, these details and assigned roles can be edited.
