# Settings

## Authorization

The Authorization section includes the pages where user roles and permissions are defined and managed within the Lidia Console. In the Lidia Marketplace system, authorization is designed around a role-based approach rather than a user-based structure. This model enables centralized control and management of users’ access levels and permitted actions through assigned roles. The Authorization section consists of two main areas: Roles and Users.

*   ### **Roles**

    Under the Roles section, the predefined roles provided by Lidia are displayed under **Lidia Roles**. These roles are configured to cover the platform’s standard usage scenarios. In addition, new roles can be created based on organization-specific needs, the created roles can be deleted, and users assigned to a role can be viewed through the role detail screen. For each role, permissions can be configured across all modules and capabilities available in the system.

    Roles can be configured with the following permission levels:

    * View permission
    * Edit permission
    * Both view and edit permissions

    Roles created later represent customized permission sets tailored to the specific needs of the project and the organization. These roles are referenced across the system to enforce authorization consistently.
*   ### **Users**

    Under the Users section, a list of all registered users in the system is displayed. From this list, you can view each user’s first and last name, email address, assigned roles, system registration date, and user status (Active / Passive). By using the **Create New User** button located in the upper-right corner, a new member can be created by entering the following information:

    \
    By accessing an individual user’s detail page, you can view basic user information such as first and last name, email address, phone number, and date of birth, as well as role and permission details.

{% hint style="success" %}
Depending on the permissions assigned to the user, this information and the assigned roles can be edited.
{% endhint %}

## Legal

The Legal section is the area where the organization’s legal obligations, documentation, and responsible institution information are centrally managed within the Lidia Console. This section ensures that legal content published on the platform is managed in an up-to-date, traceable, and versioned manner.

*   ### **Consent Documents**

    When accessing the Legal Documents section, a document list is displayed containing the document ID, name, publisher, document code, version information, validity date, and active/passive status. In this area, legal documents such as KVKK texts, preliminary information forms, and similar documents can be uploaded, and uploaded documents can be versioned through this section.

Through document versioning, it is possible to perform checks in later stages, such as identifying who approved or did not approve specific versions of a document. From the Basic Information area on the document detail screen, the document content can be accessed and edited. Additionally, the complete version history of the document can be viewed through the Version History section on the detail screen.

*   ### **Liables**

    Under the liables section, a list is displayed containing the name, address, and country information of the institution or institutions responsible for the management of the Lidia Console. By navigating to the details of a record, the institution’s basic information and the list of legal documents published by that institution can be accessed.

    Using the button located in the upper-right corner of the screen, a new data controller can be added.
