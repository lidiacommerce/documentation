# Operational Tasks

The Operational Tasks section is the area where background processes that support the technical and operational continuity of the platform are managed. This section is designed to maintain system performance, ensure data consistency, and enable quick responses to instant or periodic operational needs. Especially after high traffic, data updates, or system-level changes, the tools that support the platform’s operation with up-to-date and accurate data are provided under this heading.

### **Cache Management**

The Cache Management page is the central area where you can monitor and manage the cache structures used in the system. On this page, the total data counts of the caches created across the platform are displayed, providing an overall view of the current cache status. Caches are used to improve system performance, reduce page load times, and enable faster access to frequently used data.

Through this area, all cache data can be cleared in bulk when needed. Bulk clearing is generally preferred after changes to prices, stock, campaigns, content, or configurations to ensure that the system regenerates the most up-to-date data. In addition, by accessing cache detail screens, it is also possible to selectively delete cache records belonging only to specific data groups. This allows relevant data to be refreshed without affecting the entire system.

The Cache Management section plays a critical role in operational control, troubleshooting, and ensuring that changes made in the system are accurately reflected in the user interface. With this structure, Console admins can manage platform performance in a controlled and secure manner.
