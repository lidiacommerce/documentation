# Merchants

The Sellers section is where all sellers, business partners, and dealers defined in your marketplace system are centrally managed. Through this section, existing sellers and dealers can be listed, marketplace statuses can be monitored, and seller-related operational information can be viewed. In addition, new sellers who apply through the onboarding process can be displayed and evaluated in this area.

Each seller’s application and profile information can be reviewed in detail, and approval or rejection actions can be performed for applications. Furthermore, depending on organizational needs, new seller and dealer additions can also be carried out manually through the system. The Sellers section supports the end-to-end management of the seller and dealer lifecycle, contributing to the controlled and sustainable operation of marketplace processes.<br>

*   ### **Seller List**

    When the Seller List page is opened, there are two main sections: **Sellers** and **Applications**. Under the Sellers section, the names, ID numbers, and active/passive statuses of all sellers defined in the system are listed in the initial view. By clicking the Details button next to each seller, you can access a total of 13 different screens containing detailed information about the selected seller. The seller can be removed from the system using the delete button located on the same row.

    The **Import Data** button located in the upper-right section of the Sellers page is used for bulk seller creation. Through this button, the sample Excel template provided by the Lidia Console can be downloaded. After editing this file by entering the required basic seller information and uploading it back to the system, sellers can be added to the list in bulk. This method is particularly used to reduce manual data entry during high-volume seller onboarding processes.

    Using the **Export Data** button, an Excel file containing the basic information of all listed sellers or selected sellers can be exported. This operation can be used for reporting, analysis, archiving, or data sharing with other systems. The **Add New Seller** button located next to the Export Data button is accessible on both the Sellers and Applications screens.

### **Add New Seller**

When the Add New Seller button is clicked, basic information such as the seller name, company type ( individual company, sole proprietorship, joint-stock/limited company ) ,  product catalog type  ( physical, digital, physical and digital) and page URL address is requested. After entering this information, the onboarding process continues with the next steps. If the process is exited before completion, the seller is considered to be created in draft status, and the seller status is displayed as _Draft_ in the list.

The onboarding process consists of the following steps:

* Authorized Information
* Company Information
* Store and Operation Information
* Company Documents
* Preview and Approval

Once all steps are completed, the seller application is listed in the system with a Approved or Rejected status.



*   ### **Applications**

    Under the **Applications** section on the Seller List page, sellers who have applied through the onboarding process are listed. In this list, columns display the organization name, role, application owner, application date, and application status. This area is used for evaluating new seller applications and tracking the onboarding process.
