The Sellers section is where all sellers, business partners, and dealers defined in your marketplace system are centrally managed. Through this section, existing sellers and dealers can be listed, marketplace statuses can be monitored, and seller-related operational information can be viewed. In addition, new sellers who apply through the onboarding process can be displayed and evaluated in this area.

Each seller’s application and profile information can be reviewed in detail, and approval or rejection actions can be performed for applications. Furthermore, depending on organizational needs, new seller and dealer additions can also be carried out manually through the system. The Sellers section supports the end-to-end management of the seller and dealer lifecycle, contributing to the controlled and sustainable operation of marketplace processes.<br>

*   ### **Seller List**

    When the Seller List page is opened, there are two main sections: **Sellers** and **Applications**. Under the Sellers section, the names, ID numbers, and active/passive statuses of all sellers defined in the system are listed in the initial view. By clicking the Details button next to each seller, you can access a total of 13 different screens containing detailed information about the selected seller. The seller can be removed from the system using the delete button located on the same row.

    The **Import Data** button located in the upper-right section of the Sellers page is used for bulk seller creation. Through this button, the sample Excel template provided by the Lidia Console can be downloaded. After editing this file by entering the required basic seller information and uploading it back to the system, sellers can be added to the list in bulk. This method is particularly used to reduce manual data entry during high-volume seller onboarding processes.

    Using the **Export Data** button, an Excel file containing the basic information of all listed sellers or selected sellers can be exported. This operation can be used for reporting, analysis, archiving, or data sharing with other systems.&#x20;

### **Add New Seller**

When the Add New Seller button is clicked, basic information such as the seller name, company type ( individual company, sole proprietorship, joint-stock/limited company ) ,  product catalog type  ( physical, digital, physical and digital) and page URL address is requested. After entering this information, the onboarding process continues with the next steps. If the process is exited before completion, the seller is considered to be created in draft status, and the seller status is displayed as _Draft_ in the list.

The onboarding process consists of the following steps:

* Authorized Information
* Company Information
* Store and Operation Information
* Company Documents
* Preview and Approval

Once all steps are completed, the seller application is listed in the system with a Approved or Rejected status.



*   ### **Applications**

    Under the **Applications** section on the Seller List page, sellers who have applied through the onboarding process are listed. In this list, columns display the organization name, role, application owner, application date, and application status. This area is used for evaluating new seller applications and tracking the onboarding process.

### **Seller Detail Screens**

Within the Sellers section of the Lidia Console, the Seller List page allows you to navigate to each seller’s detail screens to track seller-related information. By clicking the Details button for a seller, multiple detail screens associated with that seller are displayed. These screens enable end-to-end monitoring of the seller’s store status, performance, company information, and operational structures.

#### **1. Store Dashboard**

The Store Dashboard is the main screen where the overall status and performance of the seller’s store are summarized. In this area, store name, store code, associated organization, active and published status, and application details are displayed in the summary panel at the top.

Below this section, the **first look** area displays the store rating, total earnings, number of active products, number of active categories, and a sales chart. From the store rating panel, access to the store evaluation report is provided, while the total earnings panel and sales chart allow navigation to the store sales reports.

Under the **Store Performance** section, key performance metrics are displayed, including total order count, average order value, order fulfillment rate, average delivery time, return rate, and number of pending orders. From the total orders, order fulfillment rate, and pending orders sections, users can navigate to the [Orders](orders.md) page under the Sales section in the left menu to view all orders associated with the store.

The Main İnfo screen is where store and company details related to the seller are displayed and managed. On this screen, store status information (such as active, passive, draft, ready to publish, deleted, or frozen) and store-related details such as the store name can be accessed.

**Company information** including company type, tax office, tax number, and trade registry number, as well as detailed **address information**, are also available on this screen. At the bottom of the page, the **Warehouse Information** section displays the warehouses used by the store for return processing and product shipment operations. The addresses and types of return warehouses and outbound warehouses used for product shipments are listed here. Multiple warehouses can be added, and they can be set as default based on their operational purpose.

#### **3. Filter Management**

The Filter Management section is where the filters that will be displayed with priority on listing pages are defined in order to improve the user experience. Through this section, filters that help users find products more quickly and easily can be configured.

Lidia Console provides the following main filter categories during the filter configuration process:

* Categories
* Trademarks
* Price Range
* Properties
* Options
* Tags

From the options under these categories, the ones suitable for your store can be selected to create customized filter sets. The created filter sets can be configured according to store needs, and the order of the filters within each set can be customized as desired.
