The Sellers section is where all sellers, business partners, and dealers defined in your marketplace system are centrally managed. Through this section, existing sellers and dealers can be listed, marketplace statuses can be monitored, and seller-related operational information can be viewed. In addition, new sellers who apply through the onboarding process can be displayed and evaluated in this area.

Each seller’s application and profile information can be reviewed in detail, and approval or rejection actions can be performed for applications. Furthermore, depending on organizational needs, new seller and dealer additions can also be carried out manually through the system. The Sellers section supports the end-to-end management of the seller and dealer lifecycle, contributing to the controlled and sustainable operation of marketplace processes.<br>

*   ### **Seller List**

    When the Seller List page is opened, there are two main sections: **Sellers** and **Applications**. Under the Sellers section, the names, ID numbers, and active/passive statuses of all sellers defined in the system are listed in the initial view. By clicking the Details button next to each seller, you can access a total of 13 different screens containing detailed information about the selected seller. The seller can be removed from the system using the delete button located on the same row.

    The **Import Data** button located in the upper-right section of the Sellers page is used for bulk seller creation. Through this button, the sample Excel template provided by the Lidia Console can be downloaded. After editing this file by entering the required basic seller information and uploading it back to the system, sellers can be added to the list in bulk. This method is particularly used to reduce manual data entry during high-volume seller onboarding processes.

    Using the **Export Data** button, an Excel file containing the basic information of all listed sellers or selected sellers can be exported. This operation can be used for reporting, analysis, archiving, or data sharing with other systems.&#x20;

After entering this information, the onboarding process continues with the next steps. If the process is exited before completion, the seller is considered to be created in draft status, and the seller status is displayed as _Draft_ in the list.

The onboarding process consists of the following steps:

* Authorized Information

* Preview and Approval

Once all steps are completed, the seller application is listed in the system with a Approved or Rejected status.

    Under the **Applications** section on the Seller List page, sellers who have applied through the onboarding process are listed. In this list, columns display the organization name, role, application owner, application date, and application status.

### **Seller Detail Screens**

Within the Sellers section of the Lidia Console, the Seller List page allows you to navigate to each seller’s detail screens to track seller-related information.

From the **Add Section** area located at the bottom of the page, ready-made sections, blocks, and basic components provided by the Lidia Console can be added to the page. This structure allows flexible and manageable page layouts to be created without the need for coding.

Within the Sections area, general content structures can be defined. For example, four-card homepage layouts, monthly deals sections, campaign showcases, or featured content areas can be created. When adding a section, a basic component is first selected from the list. These basic components include paragraph, button, simple list, divider, video, image, showcase, and advanced list.

By combining the selected basic components, page sections are created and can be positioned on the store page in the desired order. This structure enables sellers to customize their store pages in line with their brand identity and marketing needs.
