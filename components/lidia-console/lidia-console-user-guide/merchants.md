# Merchants

The Sellers section is where all sellers, business partners, and dealers defined in your marketplace system are centrally managed. Through this section, existing sellers and dealers can be listed, marketplace statuses can be monitored, and seller-related operational information can be viewed. In addition, new sellers who apply through the onboarding process can be displayed and evaluated in this area.

Each seller’s application and profile information can be reviewed in detail, and approval or rejection actions can be performed for applications. Furthermore, depending on organizational needs, **new seller and dealer additions** can also be carried out manually through the system. The Sellers section supports the end-to-end management of the seller and dealer lifecycle, contributing to the controlled and sustainable operation of marketplace processes.
