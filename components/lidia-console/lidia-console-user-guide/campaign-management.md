# Campaign Management

The Campaign Management section is the area where campaigns and coupons are centrally defined, managed, and tracked on the marketplace platform. Through this section, different campaign and coupon structures can be created to support sales, increase customer engagement, and manage marketing setups. In addition, access to past campaigns and coupons enables retrospective analysis, allowing campaign performance to be evaluated and future marketing strategies to be planned more effectively based on the insights obtained. The Campaign Management module allows marketing activities to be carried out in a controlled, measurable, and sustainable manner.

This section essentially consists of two main headings: **Campaigns** and **Coupons**.

### **Campaigns**

The Campaigns section is the area where campaigns suitable for different marketing scenarios on the marketplace are created, managed, and their performance is tracked. This area enables the design of campaigns aimed at different business objectives such as customer acquisition, sales growth, and post-sales incentives.

When entering the Campaigns page, a new campaign can be created via the Add New Campaign button located in the upper right corner of the screen. During the campaign creation process, a campaign name is entered and the campaign type is determined based on its intended use. Membership campaigns target users who are members of the platform or who meet specific membership criteria. Promotional campaigns are used to acquire new users or to highlight specific products and services. Purchase campaigns include discounts and benefits designed to encourage users to make purchases. Post-sales campaigns are designed to support customer satisfaction and repeat purchases after an order has been completed.

At this stage, the campaign start and end dates, the campaign scenario (creating a custom campaign or creating a predefined campaign), and a selection from predefined campaigns are also required. When the option to create a custom campaign is selected, the predefined campaigns field is not displayed.

All created campaigns are listed under the All tab on the Campaigns page. In this list, the campaign name, priority order, campaign type, date information, and campaign status (active, passive, suspended, test, blocked) are displayed on a single screen. For all or selected campaigns in the list, campaign statuses can be updated in bulk using the Bulk Update button located in the upper right corner.

The Campaigns page is also divided into subheadings as Live, Not Live, and Expired. Campaigns that are actively applied are listed under the Live tab, campaigns with a passive status are listed under the Not Live tab, and campaigns whose validity period has ended are listed under the Expired tab.

When entering the detail screen of any listed campaign, a total of 10 main pages that enable actions on the campaign are displayed. From the campaign detail screen, the campaign can be duplicated or deleted.

The pages available on the campaign detail screen and their main functions are as follows:

* **Summary and Performance:** The campaign creation date, start date, and planned end date are displayed. The Pause Campaign Validity and End Campaign Validity buttons in this area allow management of the campaign status. Side panels display the campaign audience, reach and usage rates, as well as revenue and cost information generated by the campaign. At the bottom of the page, a usage detail chart is presented based on the selected date range.
* **Audience:** Used to determine who the campaign will be applied to. The audience type can be selected as Everyone, Fixed Audience, or Custom Audience. When a fixed audience is selected, specific users can be imported by downloading the sample Excel file provided by the Console. In the custom audience option, a dynamic audience can be created by adding criteria such as user ID, email, age, gender, city, district, and segment using AND/OR logic.
* **Conditions and Rewards:** This page defines under which conditions the campaign will be valid and what rewards it will provide. Conditions can be created for fields such as category, brand, merchant, product, variant, product group, cart amount, and payment channel. The campaign can be configured to apply to the entire cart, specific products, or only to users who meet the conditions. Percentage-based or fixed-amount discounts, coupon definitions, and segment associations can be configured.
* **Restrictions:** This page is used to define restrictions such as whether the campaign can be combined with other campaigns, per-user usage limits, total campaign usage limits, and maximum discount amounts per order.
* **Settings:** Basic campaign information can be viewed and edited. In the lower section of the page, the campaign content can be enriched by adding a short description, long description, campaign tag, and small and large images.
* **Cost Settings:** A target cost amount can be defined for the campaign, and the campaign usage can be automatically stopped when this cost is reached. The cost type can be selected as marketplace, seller, or shared.
* **Properties:** This page allows predefined attributes in the system to be added to the campaign, enabling campaigns to be associated with additional properties for reporting and classification purposes.
* **Page Management:** A dedicated page can be created for the campaign. In this area, the page name, template, tags, and page code can be configured. Using the **Add Section** area at the bottom of the page, the page can be further customized with sections, blocks, and basic element components provided by the Console.
* **SEO:** Search engine optimization is enabled by defining the meta title, meta description, and URL for the campaign page.
* **Slugs:** Addresses and priority orders related to the campaign page are defined in this area. This structure is used to determine through which URL and with what priority the campaign page will be published within the platform.
