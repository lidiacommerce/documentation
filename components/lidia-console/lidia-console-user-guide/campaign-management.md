# Campaign Management

The Campaign Management section is the area where campaigns and coupons are centrally defined, managed, and tracked on the marketplace platform. Through this section, different campaign and coupon structures can be created to support sales, increase customer engagement, and manage marketing setups. In addition, access to past campaigns and coupons enables retrospective analysis, allowing campaign performance to be evaluated and future marketing strategies to be planned more effectively based on the insights obtained. The Campaign Management module allows marketing activities to be carried out in a controlled, measurable, and sustainable manner.

This section essentially consists of two main headings: **Campaigns** and **Coupons**.
