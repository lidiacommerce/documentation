# Sales

The Sales section is the central area where all orders that have taken place on the marketplace are tracked and analyzed end to end. Through this section, it is possible to view in detail which customer made a purchase, from which store, on which date, and for what amount. Order statuses, included products, payment information, and delivery processes can be monitored from this area, enabling both real-time and historical tracking of sales operations.

## **Orders**

The Orders page is located under the Sales module and is the area where all orders created on the platform are listed in detail, filtered, and tracked on an individual order basis. This page enables monitoring each step of the order lifecycle and allows intervention when necessary.

When you enter the Orders page, the summary panel located at the top of the screen displays key metrics that allow you to quickly review the overall situation. In this area, the Number of Orders, Number of Ordered Products, Number of Canceled / Returned Orders, Number of Approved Orders, and Number of Delivered / Completed Orders are shown respectively. The purpose of this summary panel is to enable you to evaluate the general status of order operations at a glance and to facilitate daily operational control.

Below the summary panel, the main table lists all orders in the system. This list consists of the columns Order ID, Reference No, Customer Name (including the customer’s email and phone number information), Total Amount, Tags, Order Date, and Order Status. Thanks to the filtering tools provided on the listing screen, you can analyze your orders in detail and manage your operational workload effectively. With the filtering options, orders can be narrowed down by the selected date range, minimum–maximum order amount, order status, and organizational breakdowns. Order status–based filtering options include pending delivery, new order, order in process, prepared order, invoiced orders, delivered orders, completed orders, expired orders, canceled orders, returned orders, and undeliverable orders. In addition, orders can also be filtered by sellers, dealers, user type (guest or registered user), predefined tags in the system, and orders with invoice requests only.

You can export selected orders or all orders in the list to Excel format using the Export Data button located at the top right of the page and document your order data. This feature provides operational convenience for use cases such as reporting, archiving, and data sharing with different teams.

### **Order Detail**

When you navigate to the detail of any order listed, the order’s date and time information along with the order tags assigned to the order are displayed at the top of the page under the Order Detail heading with the #XXXX ID number. An order may have more than one tag. Order tags are used to differentiate orders from one another, facilitate order tracking, and standardize operational classification. From this screen, you can add new tags to the order or remove existing ones.

**1) Summary Template**

The first template displayed on the order detail screen is the Summary section. This area presents the most critical order information in a single view. Within the summary template, the customer’s full name, email or phone number (displayed based on the method selected by the customer during registration), order date and time, order amount (TRY), order number (copyable), order reference number (copyable), and order status are shown. This template serves as a reference point to verify the core identity details of the order and to quickly initiate operational processes.

**2) Customer Information Template**

Located on the right side of the summary template, the Customer Information template displays detailed information about the customer who placed the order. This area includes the customer’s full name, Guest User / Registered User status, and email/phone details. In the row below, delivery information is shown, including the Contact Number and Delivery Address. Using the Update Delivery Address button, the delivery address can be changed; any update made here applies only to the relevant order.

Following the customer template, the Individual Invoice Address and then the Platform Information section are displayed. The Platform Information section enables monitoring of the customer’s overall behavior on the platform and presents metrics such as Membership Date, Last Order Date, Total Order Amount, Total Order Count, and Total Cancellation/Return Request Count. This area supports operational decision-making by allowing a quick evaluation of the customer’s history.

**3) Notes Section**

Below the customer information template, the Notes section is located. By adding notes to orders, you can record important details related to the order, ensure information continuity within the team, and prevent the loss of critical information. Notes are visible only to users who have access to this page, and multiple notes can be added for the same order. This area is generally used for internal operational notes, exceptional case records, or customer communication notes.

**4) Order Activity Template**

Located below the Notes section, the Order Activity template lists all steps that occur from the moment the customer adds the product to the cart until the order is completed, together with date and time information, in chronological order. This section is critical for verifying the steps experienced during the order process and for performing root cause analysis in case of potential issues.

The listed core steps are displayed under the following headings:

* Entered the order process
* Payment preference selected
* Invoice address selected
* Payment successfully completed
* Order process completed
* Order status updated
* Order shipped
* Order delivered

The steps displayed vary depending on the current status of the order; for example, for orders with a status of new, the process is typically visible up to the “Order process completed” step, whereas for orders with a status of in delivery process, the steps may be displayed up to the “Order shipped” stage.

**5) Order Account Breakdown Template**

The Order Account Breakdown template, located below the summary template, presents the revenue and cost items of the order in an itemized and accounted manner with detailed sub-breakdowns. This area allows you to analyze the financial impact of the order, platform costs, and seller shares in a single consolidated view.
