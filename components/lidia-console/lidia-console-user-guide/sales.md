# Sales

The Sales section is the central area where all orders that have taken place on the marketplace are tracked and analyzed end to end. Through this section, it is possible to view in detail which customer made a purchase, from which store, on which date, and for what amount. Order statuses, included products, payment information, and delivery processes can be monitored from this area, enabling both real-time and historical tracking of sales operations.

## **Orders**

The Orders page is located under the Sales module and is the area where all orders created on the platform are listed in detail, filtered, and tracked on an individual order basis. This page enables monitoring each step of the order lifecycle and allows intervention when necessary.

When you enter the Orders page, the summary panel located at the top of the screen displays key metrics that allow you to quickly review the overall situation. In this area, the Number of Orders, Number of Ordered Products, Number of Canceled / Returned Orders, Number of Approved Orders, and Number of Delivered / Completed Orders are shown respectively. The purpose of this summary panel is to enable you to evaluate the general status of order operations at a glance and to facilitate daily operational control.

Below the summary panel, the main table lists all orders in the system. This list consists of the columns Order ID, Reference No, Customer Name (including the customer’s email and phone number information), Total Amount, Tags, Order Date, and Order Status. Thanks to the filtering tools provided on the listing screen, you can analyze your orders in detail and manage your operational workload effectively. With the filtering options, orders can be narrowed down by the selected date range, minimum–maximum order amount, order status, and organizational breakdowns. Order status–based filtering options include pending delivery, new order, order in process, prepared order, invoiced orders, delivered orders, completed orders, expired orders, canceled orders, returned orders, and undeliverable orders. In addition, orders can also be filtered by sellers, dealers, user type (guest or registered user), predefined tags in the system, and orders with invoice requests only.

You can export selected orders or all orders in the list to Excel format using the Export Data button located at the top right of the page and document your order data. This feature provides operational convenience for use cases such as reporting, archiving, and data sharing with different teams.
