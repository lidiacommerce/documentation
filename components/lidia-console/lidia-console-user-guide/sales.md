# Sales

The Sales section is the central area where all orders that have taken place on the marketplace are tracked and analyzed end to end. Through this section, it is possible to view in detail which customer made a purchase, from which store, on which date, and for what amount. Order statuses, included products, payment information, and delivery processes can be monitored from this area, enabling both real-time and historical tracking of sales operations.
