# Content Management

Content section is the central area where the page structures, visual areas, and user-facing content within the marketplace are managed. Under this heading, the platform’s interface, navigation structure, and showcase layouts can be customized, configured according to different scenarios, and managed through dynamic content controls. Thanks to content management, page layouts, redirects, and visual components can be controlled without the need for technical development, supporting both user experience and operational flexibility.

## Templates

In the marketplace system, **T**emplates are predefined structures that enable product and content information to be created with a standard visual and structural layout. Templates under the Content section are designed to ensure that, especially in PDP areas, headings, text fields, and content blocks are presented with the same visual hierarchy and layout logic. This structure provides consistency across the platform and prevents manual and unstructured content creation.

A new template can be created using the Add Template button located in the top-right corner of the Template Management page. During the template creation process, the template type and template name must first be defined. The template type is selected from the options provided by the system: Section, Showcase, Showcase Page, Special List, and Block. During the creation process, the system checks whether the template complies with the rule set of the selected type, and the creation is completed once compliance is confirmed.

All created templates are listed on the Template Management page. When navigating to the details of any template, the user is presented with the Template Type, Template Name, Description, Category, Cover Image, Preview Image, and the main Template Content area where configuration is performed. These fields allow the basic template information to be viewed and edited.

In the Lidia Console, the Template Content area is empty by default. This area is populated only within the structure provided by the selected template type before content is created. Templates do not offer a free-form structure; each template operates with a specific content and layout logic aligned with its intended use.

Within this scope, the Console administrator:

* Creates the template content in accordance with the template types provided by Lidia
* May request the preparation or modification of template content from the Lidia Admin when needed

Templates predefine:

* [x] Which fields the content will consist of
* [x] In which layout these fields will be displayed on the page
* [x] Within which template type the content will be used

Thanks to this structure, content is created with a standard layout, visual and structural consistency is maintained, and content management is handled centrally.

Lidia provides 5 different template types for use in content management. Each template type is designed for a different usage scenario:\
**Section**\
Used to create a separate content area within a page. It allows content to be grouped within a specific layout.\
**Showcase**\
Used to prominently display content, campaigns, or visuals that need to stand out.\
**Showcase Page**\
Used for independent, full-page content created with a showcase logic.\
**Special List**\
Allows multiple items with the same structure to be displayed as a list with a defined ordering logic.\
**Block**\
Used to create small, modular, and reusable content areas within a page.
