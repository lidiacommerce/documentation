# Finance

The Finance section is the central area where all payment transactions carried out on the marketplace are monitored, analyzed, and verified. Through this section, it is possible to track end-to-end which order a payment belongs to, which customer made the payment, the payment amount, the payment method used, and the date on which the payment was completed. The Finance module strengthens both operational and financial control by clearly displaying the order–payment matching. At the same time, it provides a reference structure for identifying, reporting, and, when necessary, technically analyzing issues that may occur in payment flows.

## Payments

The Payments page is the main screen under the Finance module where all payment transactions that have occurred in the system are listed. Each payment record displayed on this page is shown as directly matched with the order to which it belongs. When the order number of any listed payment is clicked, the user is automatically redirected to the [**Sales**](sales.md) **> Orders** page located in the Console left menu and can access the relevant order’s detail screen. This structure enables quick and consistent review of the relationship between payments and orders.

In the list presented on the Payments page, the following information is displayed in columns: the customer’s first and last name, email address, payment amount, masked card number for card payments, payment method, payment date, and payment status. Payment statuses are categorized as Unknown Transactions, Completed Transactions, Redirected Transactions, Expired Transactions, Failed Transactions, Rejected Transactions, and Pending Transactions. Thanks to the filtering tools available on the listing screen, payments can be filtered and analyzed based on payment status, a specified minimum–maximum amount range, and other operational criteria.

When navigating to the details of any payment listed, the user is first presented with the Summary Template. This area contains the most essential information related to the payment transaction. The summary template displays the transaction code, transaction amount (TRY), transaction type, the card information used (masked), and the transaction date. This template serves as a reference point for quickly verifying the identity and validation details of the payment.

Below the summary template is the Details Template, which is designed for technical review purposes. The Details template presents a response model structured in JSON format and contains technical status information returned by the system or the payment provider during the payment process. This area displays technical messages such as the transaction status (successful or failed), error codes, and related error descriptions. The information shown is generally intended to inform about integration issues, missing or incorrect parameters, or business rule violations. The Details area particularly supports technical and operations teams in quickly identifying the root cause of issues encountered during the payment process. This section is for informational purposes only and contains system messages that do not require direct user action.

With this structure, the Finance and Payments module enables payment processes to be managed in a transparent, traceable, and auditable manner from both operational and technical perspectives.
