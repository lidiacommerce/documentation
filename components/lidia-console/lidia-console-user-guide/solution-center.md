# Solution Center

The Solution Center is the central area where requests and feedback created by users, sellers, or the system within the marketplace are collected, categorized, and tracked in a unified structure. Through this section, it is possible to monitor what each request is related to, the type of request created, and its current status from a single screen. In addition, by managing request types, it becomes possible to control which topics users can create requests for and through which channels. The Solution Center plays a critical role in terms of operational visibility, feedback management, and process standardization.

This section consists of two main headings: **Requests** and **Request Types**.

### **Requests**

The Requests page is the area where all requests and feedback created within the system are listed and monitored. On this page, each request is displayed in a single list together with its request number and creation date. This enables time-based tracking of requests and analysis of operational workload.

Using the **Export Data** button located at the top right of the page, either selected requests or all listed requests can be exported in Excel format. This feature can be used for reporting, archiving, and sharing with different teams.

When navigating to the detail view of any listed request, the basic information of the user who created the request is displayed. This information includes the user’s first and last name, email address, and phone number. This structure clarifies the relationship between the request and the user, supporting quick responses and accurate communication.

### **Request Types**

The Request Types page is used to define and manage the topics and categories under which requests can be created within the system. This area ensures that requests are collected under a standardized structure and handled by the appropriate teams.

By using the Add New Request Type button located at the top right of the page, a new request type can be created. During the request type creation process, the relevant communication type is selected to configure the request. The communication types defined in the system are grouped under the following headings:

* **ORDER:**\
  Requests related to orders, such as order cancel request, order refund request, and order address change request.
* **PAYMENT:**\
  Requests related to payment and invoicing, such as order invoice request.
* **COMMUNICATION:**\
  General communication requests such as support and help request, partnership request, and general information request.
* **FEEDBACK:**\
  User feedback and complaints such as feedback and suggestion, and complaint and issue reporting.

When navigating to the detail view of any listed communication type on the Request Types page, information such as request type, request name, description, and request status is displayed. These fields can be edited to update existing request types or to deactivate them when necessary. This allows control over which request types are actively used and presented to users within the system.
