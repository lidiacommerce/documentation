# Audit Reports

Audit Reports are a reporting area designed to ensure the traceability and transparency of all critical actions performed on the platform. This section enables user activities to be logged, reviewed retrospectively, and operational processes to be auditable. It serves as a key reference point for system security, internal control mechanisms, and regulatory compliance.

### **Transaction Logs**

The Transaction Logs page is the area within audit reports where all user actions performed on the platform are listed in detail. When this page is accessed, under the Audit Logs heading, the first and last names of users, IP addresses, date and time of the action, and the type of action performed by users who have logged into the system or made any changes are displayed on a single screen.

The primary purpose of this section is to make it visible that all activities within the operational system are recorded and to provide access to reports of these activities when needed. Configuration changes, updates, and other critical actions performed in the Console can be monitored here. This allows authorized users to review past actions retrospectively, identify the source of potential issues or unauthorized activities, and manage audit processes in a reliable and effective manner.
