# Goal Management

The Goal Management section is the area where operational goals to be applied to sellers—especially logistics-focused goals—are defined and managed in line with the strategies you determine for your marketplace platform. Through this section, seller performance can be guided based on specific criteria, and improvements in operational processes can be supported. Defined goals can be applied on a category-based or seller-based level, providing a flexible targeting structure.

### **Goals**

A new goal can be defined using the **New Goal** button located in the upper-right corner of the Goals page. During the goal creation process, information such as the goal name, goal type (logistics), goal subtype (for example, order delivery to carrier time), goal date range, goal day selection, and goal duration definition (based on hours, days, or time intervals) is entered. Based on this information, a new goal is created in the system.

All defined goals are displayed as a list on the Goals page. This list is filterable, and by using the **Bulk Update** button, the status of selected goals can be updated collectively as active or passive. Users can remove goals from the system using the **Delete** button when necessary.

* ### **Goal Details**

When navigating to the details of any listed goal, two main sections are displayed: **Basic Information** and **Goal Scope**. On the Basic Information page, all details entered during goal creation are displayed, and these details can be edited if needed.

The Goal Scope page is used to determine where the defined goal will be applied. The goal can be applied on a category-based or seller-based level. When category-based application is selected, a selection must be made from all categories and subcategories previously defined in the system. When seller-based application is selected, the options **all sellers** or **specific sellers** are presented. If the specific sellers option is chosen, the names of the sellers to whom the goal will be applied must be entered to complete the targeting.

Through this structure, logistics goals can be applied in a controlled and measurable manner across the entire marketplace or specifically for certain sellers and categories.
