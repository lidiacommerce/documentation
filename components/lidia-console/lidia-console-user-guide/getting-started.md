# Getting Started

### **HomePage**

The Home Page is the first screen you encounter when you log in to the Lidia Console. From this screen, you can access all platform management processes, configure system settings, and monitor your notifications. While operational and administrative actions are performed through the modules listed in the left navigation menu, the top-right area allows you to switch language preferences, view system notifications, access and manage personal and organization-related account information, or securely log out of the platform.
