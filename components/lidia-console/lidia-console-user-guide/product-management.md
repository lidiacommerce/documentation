# Product Management

The Product Management section is the main management area that enables all products uploaded by sellers on the marketplace to be created and managed under a single catalog structure, within the rules defined by the platform. Since the system operates with a single catalog logic, sellers can upload products only through the category structures and data schemas determined by the platform. Thanks to this approach, all product data is collected within a standardized, consistent, and centralized data tree; category confusion, field incompatibilities, and data inconsistencies are prevented.

Within this section, operations such as defining the fields and criteria that sellers will use during product uploads, creating categories and category sets, managing product pools, defining brands, and structuring product–variant relationships are carried out. The Product Management area functions as the central structure that determines which category a product belongs to, which mandatory fields it must be uploaded with, how the variant structure is established, and how the product is represented across the marketplace. In this way, product entry processes on the seller side are kept under control, while listing, operational, and reporting processes proceed on a consistent data structure.
