# Reports

The Reports section is a centralized reporting area designed to measure, analyze, and support decision-making processes for all commercial and operational activities carried out on the marketplace. Through this section, sales performance, operational processes, cost structures, campaign effectiveness, and legal reporting requirements can be comprehensively monitored. Reports provide managers, operations teams, and finance teams with the ability to evaluate the current state of the platform using numerical data and to take strategic actions.

Under the Reports heading, there are five main sub-sections: **Sales Reports**, **Operations Reports**, **Cost Reports**, **Campaign Reports**, and **Withholding Tax Declaration Reports**. All of these reports are structured to offer a consistent user experience. On each report screen, the Export Data button located in the upper-right corner allows the displayed report data to be exported in Excel format. This feature facilitates archiving reports, sharing them with different teams, and using them for further analysis.
