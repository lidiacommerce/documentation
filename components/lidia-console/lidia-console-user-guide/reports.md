# Reports

The Reports section is a centralized reporting area designed to measure, analyze, and support decision-making processes for all commercial and operational activities carried out on the marketplace. Through this section, sales performance, operational processes, cost structures, campaign effectiveness, and legal reporting requirements can be comprehensively monitored. Reports provide managers, operations teams, and finance teams with the ability to evaluate the current state of the platform using numerical data and to take strategic actions.

Under the Reports heading, there are five main sub-sections: **Sales Reports**, **Operations Reports**, **Cost Reports**, **Campaign Reports**, and **Withholding Tax Declaration Reports**. All of these reports are structured to offer a consistent user experience. On each report screen, the Export Data button located in the upper-right corner allows the displayed report data to be exported in Excel format. This feature facilitates archiving reports, sharing them with different teams, and using them for further analysis.

### Sales Report

The Sales Report section is the main reporting area where all sales realized on the marketplace can be analyzed both in summary and in detail. Under this heading, the user is first presented with a graph showing sales amount and number of products sold on a date basis. Using the date range filter on the graph, the desired period can be selected, and once a filter is applied, the order list displayed below is filtered simultaneously. This synchronized structure enables sales performance for a specific period to be evaluated both visually and in tabular form together, helping to quickly analyze periodic trends as well as increases or decreases.

Directly below the graph, a comprehensive and detailed order list related to sales is displayed. Through this list, for each order, it is possible to view in a single screen: the order reference number, line code, customer information (including the customer’s total number of orders to date, email address, and phone number), the merchant to which the order belongs, the category and brand of the product, the purchased product name and quantity, the province and district breakdown of the order address, the invoice type, and the logistics details indicating which shipping company the order was or will be shipped with.

In addition, the sales report presents revenue items such as order shipment status, payment status, shipping revenue, product revenue, and maturity difference revenue; direct cost items such as product costs and payment provider costs; and indirect cost items such as shipping, platform, and marketing costs in detail. The report also includes the date on which the order was realized, any cancellation or return costs if applicable, loyalty points used, and the current order status. In this way, an end-to-end profitability analysis can be performed for each individual order.

When the details of any order row listed are selected, the user is automatically redirected to the relevant order detail page under [**Sales**](sales.md) **> Orders** in the Console left menu. The information displayed on the order detail screen, the available actions, and the operational workflows are explained in detail under the Orders section within the [Sales](sales.md) heading. This redirection enables a seamless transition from reporting to operations, allowing analysis and action processes to be managed without interruption.
