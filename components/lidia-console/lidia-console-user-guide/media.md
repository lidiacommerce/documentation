# Media

The Media section is the central area where all images, documents, videos, and other files used across the marketplace and console are managed. Through this section, media files used in content, products, pages, or showcases can be viewed, edited, their statuses managed, and their usage areas controlled from a single location. Media management plays a critical role in maintaining content consistency, ensuring reusability of assets, and providing operational control.

## **Media List**

The Media List is the main area where all documents in the system are listed, displayed, and tracked. Documents in this area may include binary files, string files, images, videos, and audio files in various formats. The system supports a wide range of file extensions; examples include `.zip`, `.xml`, `.mp4`, `.webp`, `.xlsx`, `.dwg`, `.woff`, `.tif`, `.3gp`, `.7z`, among others.

In the list view, each media item is displayed together with its preview image, media name, file type, file extension, usage area, creation date, and status. Clicking on the thumbnail preview of any document enlarges the image, allowing a quick visual preview.

When navigating to the details of a media item, users are first presented with the Basic Information page. This page includes the uploaded document, media name, media type, file extension, media size, media URL, and media status. These details allow users to quickly review the technical properties of the file and its current status within the system.

Another key section on the media detail screen is the Usage Area section. The Usage Area indicates which content or data structures within the system a media file is used in or can be used in. In this section, users can manage the areas where the media is associated, the related usage codes, and the active or passive status of those areas. This structure enables controlled reuse of the same media across multiple contents and makes it easier to track media relationships.

At the top right of the Media List page, the Export Data button allows selected media items or the entire list to be exported in Excel format. This feature is useful for reporting and inventory tracking. Next to the Export Data button, the Bulk Update button becomes active when one or more media items are selected from the list.

Within Bulk Update operations, users can perform bulk status updates (such as active, passive, ready for publish, draft), apply bulk tag additions, and perform document matching. Through document matching, selected media items are grouped under the same usage area. Additionally, using the Download Selections option, users can download the original uploaded versions of the selected documents.

The search bar on the Media List screen allows filtering by media name, and additional filtering options are available for file type and file extension. This structure enables efficient and controlled management of large-scale media archives.
