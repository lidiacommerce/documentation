# Media

The Media section is the central area where all images, documents, videos, and other files used across the marketplace and console are managed. Through this section, media files used in content, products, pages, or showcases can be viewed, edited, their statuses managed, and their usage areas controlled from a single location. Media management plays a critical role in maintaining content consistency, ensuring reusability of assets, and providing operational control.

## **Media List**

The Media List is the main area where all documents in the system are listed, displayed, and tracked. Documents in this area may include binary files, string files, images, videos, and audio files in various formats. The system supports a wide range of file extensions; examples include `.zip`, `.xml`, `.mp4`, `.webp`, `.xlsx`, `.dwg`, `.woff`, `.tif`, `.3gp`, `.7z`, among others.

In the list view, each media item is displayed together with its preview image, media name, file type, file extension, usage area, creation date, and status. Clicking on the thumbnail preview of any document enlarges the image, allowing a quick visual preview.

When navigating to the details of a media item, users are first presented with the Basic Information page. This page includes the uploaded document, media name, media type, file extension, media size, media URL, and media status. These details allow users to quickly review the technical properties of the file and its current status within the system.

Another key section on the media detail screen is the Usage Area section. The Usage Area indicates which content or data structures within the system a media file is used in or can be used in. In this section, users can manage the areas where the media is associated, the related usage codes, and the active or passive status of those areas. This structure enables controlled reuse of the same media across multiple contents and makes it easier to track media relationships.

At the top right of the Media List page, the Export Data button allows selected media items or the entire list to be exported in Excel format. This feature is useful for reporting and inventory tracking. Next to the Export Data button, the Bulk Update button becomes active when one or more media items are selected from the list.

Within Bulk Update operations, users can perform bulk status updates (such as active, passive, ready for publish, draft), apply bulk tag additions, and perform document matching. Through document matching, selected media items are grouped under the same usage area. Additionally, using the Download Selections option, users can download the original uploaded versions of the selected documents.

The search bar on the Media List screen allows filtering by media name, and additional filtering options are available for file type and file extension. This structure enables efficient and controlled management of large-scale media archives.

## **Import Documents**

The Import Documents screen is a management area that allows a large number of images or documents to be uploaded to the system in a single operation. The upload process consists of the steps **Upload Document → Validate Data → Completed**, and each stage progresses in a controlled manner. With this structure, category, brand, and product images as well as document files can be added to the system quickly and securely in compliance with defined standards.

There are four main template types available on the upload screen:

* **Category Image** (2000×2000 px)
* **Brand Image** (2000×2000 px)
* **Product Image** (2000×2000 px)
* **Document**

To upload documents, first select the relevant document type, then add the files you want to upload in the area that opens. After the files are added, you can proceed to the next step using the Continue button.

The next step is the Validate Data stage. On this screen, all uploaded files are automatically checked according to system rules. If any media within the uploaded bulk data does not meet the required conditions in terms of format, size, or content, the system displays a warning and requests that the relevant rows be corrected.

* Supported formats for images: \
  `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.jfif`, `.webp`, `.rar`, `.zip`
* Supported formats for documents:\
  &#x20;`.rar`, `.zip`, `.3dmax`, `.3ds`, `.step`, `.stp`, `.dwg`, `.pdf`

At this stage, the Show Only Invalid Rows button simplifies the editing process by listing only the files with errors. If there are no errors in the uploaded data, the message “Your bulk data has been uploaded successfully without errors!” is displayed on the screen, and the Continue option becomes active.

In the final Confirmation step, the upload process is completed and all files are added to the system without issues. Additionally, if needed, additional files can be added during the data validation stage. This structure ensures that the bulk document upload process is managed in a controlled, traceable, and error-resistant manner.

## **Image Management**

This area represents a structure generally referred to as Centralized Media Management (MAM / DAM-like structure). All images used within the marketplace are managed from a single central location under this section.

Image Management provides a folder-based structure that works similarly to a file explorer on a computer. Images are stored under specific folders and managed in an organized manner through these folders.

This structure allows:

* Images to be stored centrally and reused
* Order and hierarchy to be maintained through folders
* Read and write permissions to be controlled
* Image types and update information to be tracked

The Image Management area aims to ensure that all images used across the platform are managed in a structured, controlled, and sustainable way.

## **File Management**

File Management is the area where all documents used within the marketplace are stored and managed in a centralized structure. Similar to image management, it operates with a folder-based structure and provides a file-explorer-like experience.

Through File Management:

* Files such as PDFs, Excel documents, images, and similar formats can be uploaded
* Files can be organized under folders
* File type, size, and update information can be viewed
* Associations between files and different content or data types can be managed

This structure enables centralized control of documents, supports reuse, and ensures a standardized file management process across the platform.

## **Video Management**

Video Management is the area where all videos used within the marketplace are stored and managed in a centralized structure. Similar to image and file management, it operates with a folder-based structure, allowing videos to be organized efficiently.

Through Video Management:

* Video files can be uploaded to the system
* Videos can be organized under folders
* Video type, size, and update information can be viewed
* Associations between videos and different content or data types can be managed

This structure ensures centralized control of video assets, supports reuse, and enables consistent video management across the platform.
