# Store Management

The Store Management area is the main configuration section where sellers using the Lidia Merchant Console manage their store’s core definitions, operational settings, and integration details. Through this section, you can update your store information, define warehouse and delivery structures, view integration access details, and manage fundamental settings related to inventory and order processes.

The core framework of the configurations in this area is defined through the **Lidia Marketplace Console**; the **Lidia Merchant Console** serves as the layer where these centralized definitions are applied, displayed, and actively used in seller-specific operational processes.

Store Management is a centralized area that contains critical configurations required for seller operations to run accurately, consistently, and without interruption.
