# Merchant Users

The Merchant Users page is the area where users with access to the Merchant Console are listed. In this section, all users who have system access on behalf of your store are displayed.

All user definition and configuration processes displayed in this section, including roles and authorizations, are carried out through the Lidia Marketplace Console. The Merchant Console serves as the layer where these definitions are applied and displayed; user creation, role assignment, or role modification actions cannot be performed through this area.

{% hint style="info" %}
When user creation, user management, or permission changes are required, these actions must be performed via **Lidia Marketplace Console →** [**Settings**](../../../lidia-console/lidia-console-user-guide/settings.md) **→ Authorization → Users**. In the Merchant Console, users are displayed only, and operational processes are carried out based on existing definitions.
{% endhint %}

On the user detail screen of any user, the following information can be viewed:\
