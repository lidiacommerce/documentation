# Store Details

The Store Details page is a configuration area that allows you to manage your store’s core identity information, contact details, operational definitions, and system integrations from a single central location. Through this page, you can view the structure defined for your store on the platform, verify the information required for operational processes to function correctly, and update it when necessary.

The Store Details page consists of four main tabs: Basic Information, Address Information, Integration Information, and Settings.
