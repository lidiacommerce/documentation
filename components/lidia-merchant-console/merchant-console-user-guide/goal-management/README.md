# Goal Management

The Goal Management section is the area where operational goals defined by the marketplace system and aimed at guiding seller performance are monitored. This section enables sellers to transparently track logistics- and operations-focused goals defined for them. By reviewing the assigned goals, sellers can clearly understand which areas they are expected to perform in and improve their operational processes accordingly.

Goal Management is structured to guide seller performance based on specific criteria, standardize processes, and increase operational efficiency.
