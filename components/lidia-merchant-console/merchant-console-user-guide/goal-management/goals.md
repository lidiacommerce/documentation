# Goals

The Goals section is where goals defined within the marketplace system and assigned to sellers are listed and monitored. In this area, sellers can view basic information related to their assigned goals, understand which operational area the goal applies to, and track the overall status of each goal.

Goals listed on this page are displayed with the following information:

* Goal Name
* Goal Type
* Goal Subtype
* Status

For example, if a logistics-based goal is defined, its subtype may be “Order Handover Time to Cargo”, representing a specific operational metric. This structure clearly shows which process is being targeted and how performance is evaluated.

*   [x] Goal content cannot be edited by the seller. All goals are defined and managed by the Marketplace admin. The Marketplace admin can define goals:

    * Category-based, or
    * Seller-based

    Seller-based goals can, at the marketplace admin’s discretion, be applied to all sellers or configured to apply only to specific sellers.

This flexible structure allows marketplace management to define tailored performance goals for different seller groups or operational scenarios.
