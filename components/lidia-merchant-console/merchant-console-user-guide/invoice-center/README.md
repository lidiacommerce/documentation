# Invoice Center

The Invoice Center is a centralized management area where sellers upload invoices generated based on delivery processes, track their current status, and access historical records. This section ensures that delivery-based invoicing processes are carried out in a controlled, traceable, and auditable manner.

Uploading invoices to the system is required to ensure that shipping and service charges related to deliveries are accurately invoiced, to enable financial reconciliation, and to create an official record for potential disputes or audit processes.

Sellers -Merchant Console users- upload invoices to the system and can track the status of the invoices they have uploaded. Uploaded invoices enter the review process of Marketplace admins via the Marketplace Console; Marketplace admins perform invoice approval or rejection actions and, when necessary, can upload invoices on behalf of the seller.

All these processes can be transparently monitored through both the Merchant Console and the Marketplace Console.
