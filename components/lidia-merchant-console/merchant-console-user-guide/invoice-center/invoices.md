# Invoices

### Invoice Section

From the moment the delivery process begins, the seller is responsible for uploading an invoice for each processed delivery. The invoice upload process is performed using the Add Invoice button located in the top-right corner of this page.

During invoice upload, the seller is required to provide the following information:

* **Invoice Number, Invoice Party** (Buyer / Platform), **Invoice Date, Invoice Type** (Individual / Company), **Invoice File** (PDF format)

Once this information is entered and the invoice file is uploaded, the invoice submission process is completed.

* #### **Invoice Statuses and Approval Process**

All invoices uploaded by the seller are collected under the All tab. Uploaded invoices are also submitted for Marketplace admin approval under the All tab on the\
Marketplace Console → [Invoice Center](../../../lidia-console/lidia-console-user-guide/invoice-center.md) → Invoices page.

At this stage, invoices appear in the Merchant Console with a Pending status and are listed under the Pending Invoices tab.

* When the Marketplace admin approves an invoice using the Approve button, the invoice is listed under the Approved Invoices tab in both the Merchant Console and the Marketplace Console.
* If the invoice is rejected using the Reject button, it is displayed under the Rejected Invoices tab along with the rejection reason.

For a rejected invoice, the seller can use the Add Invoice button again to make the necessary corrections and re-upload the invoice.

***

* [x] Invoices listed on the Invoice Center pages are displayed with the following information:

- Invoice Number, Uploaded By, Invoice Party, Invoice Type, Invoice Scope, Transaction Link, Invoice Date, Status

These details provide clear visibility into who uploaded the invoice, which transaction it is associated with, and its current approval status.

* [x] Clicking on the Transaction Link code in the list redirects the user to the Sales Management → [Delivery Management](../sales-management/delivery-management.md) page. From there, the details of the delivery associated with the invoice can be reviewed, allowing a holistic view of the delivery–invoice relationship.
* [x] All invoice information listed on the Invoice Center pages can be exported in Excel format using the Export Data button. This feature can be used for reporting, accounting processes, and archiving purposes.
