# Price/Stock List

The Price / Stock Management page is the area where sellers centrally manage the stock, pricing, and sales availability of products and variants in their inventory. This page is used to ensure that products remain available for sale, are listed with accurate pricing, and that operational disruptions caused by stock depletion are prevented.

Through this screen, sellers can view the products in their inventory and update critical price and stock fields instantly and dynamically. In addition, as a seller, you can filter the listed inventory by brand and category to more easily and quickly display products, simplifying management for large product volumes.

Using the Import Data button located in the top-right corner of the screen, price and stock data can be uploaded in bulk by selecting the relevant Excel file for the category. This method provides fast and error-free updates, especially for sellers with large product volumes.

On this page, the following information is displayed in a table format for each product variant in the inventory:

* **Product Name:** The name of the product displayed to customers on the platform and used to identify the product.
* **Barcode:** A unique identifier for the product, used for product matching and stock tracking.
* **Seller Item Code:** A reference code used by the seller to identify the product within their internal systems.
* **Group Code:** A code used to associate variants of the same product (e.g., size, color).
* **Brand:** Indicates the brand to which the product belongs and is used in reporting and filtering processes.
* **Categories:** Indicates the product’s position within the platform’s category hierarchy.
* **Variation:** Displays variant information such as color, size, or dimensions.
* **Inventory Label:** A status indicator assigned by the system based on the product’s stock condition and used for operational alerts.
* **Stock Status:** Displays the current stock quantity and the product’s availability for sale.
* **List Price:** The base selling price of the product before any campaign or discount is applied.
* **Sale Price:** The effective selling price shown to customers after discounts or campaigns are applied.

Among these fields, Inventory Label, Stock Status, List Price, and Sale Price are critical and **dynamic fields** that can be updated instantly through the Merchant Console. Changes made to these fields have a direct impact on product availability and pricing.

* #### Stock Alerts and  Indicators

If there are products with low or depleted stock levels among the listed items, the system provides alert notifications to inform the seller.

* [x] **Low-stock products** are highlighted with a **yellow line** in the table.
* [x] **Out-of-stock products** are highlighted with a **red line**.

These visual indicators enable sellers to take quick action and help prevent sales losses caused by stock shortages.
