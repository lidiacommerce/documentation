# Price/Stock List

The Price / Stock Management page is the area where sellers centrally manage the stock, pricing, and sales availability of products and variants in their inventory. This page is used to ensure that products remain available for sale, are listed with accurate pricing, and that operational disruptions caused by stock depletion are prevented.

Through this screen, sellers can view the products in their inventory and update critical price and stock fields instantly and dynamically. In addition, as a seller, you can filter the listed inventory by brand and category to more easily and quickly display products, simplifying management for large product volumes.

Using the Import Data button located in the top-right corner of the screen, price and stock data can be uploaded in bulk by selecting the relevant Excel file for the category. This method provides fast and error-free updates, especially for sellers with large product volumes.
