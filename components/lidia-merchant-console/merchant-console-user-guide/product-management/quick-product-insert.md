# Quick Product Insert

The Quick Product Insert page is a feature that allows sellers to quickly and efficiently add products that already exist in the platform catalog to their own inventory. This page is designed to eliminate repetitive product data entry, shorten product onboarding time, reduce operational workload, and accelerate the go-live process.

Through this screen, sellers can create new SKUs for their stores by using products that have already been uploaded to the platform and are in a sale-ready state, by defining only stock and pricing information. This structure provides a significant operational advantage, especially for sellers working with large catalogs and requiring rapid product publishing.

The products listed on this page are all sale-ready catalog products available on the platform. Each product is presented with the following information to enable quick selection and comparison:

-Product Name\
-Small product preview image\
-Barcode\
-Brand\
-Category\
-Variation information\
-Tax Rate

These details help sellers quickly identify the correct product and minimize the risk of incorrect product selection.

* #### Add Product from Catalog

The Add Product from Catalog section is used when there is a product in the system that is identical to the product you plan to sell. Instead of re-entering all product data, you can add the product to your inventory by defining only the following information:

* **Seller Item Code**
* **Stock**
* **List Price (₺)**
* **Sale Price (₺)**

As a result of this process, a new SKU specific to your store is created, and the product becomes ready for sale.



Sellers can filter the listed products by brand and category to quickly access the products they are looking for. This filtering capability significantly improves usability, especially when working with large product catalogs, and makes the product insertion process more efficient.
