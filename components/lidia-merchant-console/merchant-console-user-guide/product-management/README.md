# Product Management

The Product Management section is the area within the Lidia Merchant Console where sellers create, manage, and prepare their products for sale in accordance with platform standards. Through this section, you can define your product data according to the correct category structure, add products not only by creating them from scratch but also by selecting from products that already exist in the catalog, quickly upload your products to the system through bulk uploads, and prepare them for go-live by tracking approval and publishing processes.

Additionally, sellers can manage product pricing and stock information through this area, and maintain their operational processes by monitoring the current status of products available for sale.
