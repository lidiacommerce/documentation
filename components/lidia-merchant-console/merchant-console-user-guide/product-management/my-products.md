# My Products

The Products page is the main management area where you can view all your active and inactive products that you have uploaded to the system as a seller. This page is used to prepare products for sale, review existing product data, and identify any missing or incomplete fields that may need to be updated.

On this screen, products are listed together with the following information:

* **Mini Product Image:** A small preview image used to quickly identify the product.
* **Product Name:** The name of the product displayed to customers on the platform and used to distinguish the product.
* **Barcode:** A unique identifier of the product used for product matching, stock tracking, and integration processes.

    * **Low-stock products** are displayed with a **yellow line** in the table.
