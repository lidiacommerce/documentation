# Getting Started

## **Home Page**

The Home Page is the first screen you encounter when you log in to the Lidia Merchant Console. From this screen, you can access core operational processes such as product management, sales and delivery management, invoice and earnings tracking, and monitor your revenue, overall business performance, as well as sales and inventory summaries from a single central view.

Operational and administrative tasks are carried out through the modules listed in the left navigation menu. The statistical tables, KPI cards, and summary views presented on the main screen allow you to quickly assess your business status and performance at a glance.

In the top-right section of the screen, you can change language preferences, access personal and organizational account information, and securely log out of the platform.
