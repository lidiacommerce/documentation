# Accruals

The Accruals section is the main financial screen where sellers can view the net accrual amounts obtained from sold products together with all financial deductions taken into account during calculation. This page allows sellers to review both current period accruals and payments from previous periods.

* #### **Accrual Information Template**

The Accrual Information template contains the seller’s core payout and accrual definitions. This section includes:

* **Accrual Maturity:** Indicates how often accrual amounts are calculated, on a day-based basis.
* **Accrual Period:** Represents the number of days after which the seller’s accrual amount can be transferred to their account.
* **Trade Name:** Displays the seller’s official company trade name.
* **Payment IBAN Address:** The bank account information to which accrual payments will be transferred.

These details ensure that payment processes proceed accurately and consistently.

* #### **Financial Summary Template**

A secondary template displays a financial summary for the accrual period:

**TOTAL PROGRESS PAYMENT:** Represents the net amount to be paid to the seller at the end of the period. This amount is calculated by taking sales, returns, commissions, and other expenses into account.

**SALES AMOUNT:** Shows the gross total of sales completed within a specific period.

**PENDING PAYMENTS:** Includes amounts that have been processed but not yet transferred to the seller.

**PAST PAYMENTS:** Represents the total of completed payments transferred to the seller in previous periods.

**CARGO INTERRUPTION:** Represents shipping costs charged to the seller for logistics services used in orders.

**WITHOLDER:** Indicates the tax deduction calculated at a rate of 1% on the VAT-excluded sales amount.

**OTHER INTERRUPTIONS:** Includes additional deduction items such as commissions, discounts, and penalties.

This summary structure allows sellers to analyze their income–expense balance from a single screen.

* #### **Periodic Accruals List**

The list displayed in the lower section of the page presents period-based accrual details. This list includes the following columns:

Accrual Period, Estimated Payment Date, Accrual Amount, Deduction Amount, Net Accrual Amount.

This list is provided to enable sellers to track how much accrual was generated in each period, which deductions were applied, and when the payment will be made, on a period-by-period basis.
