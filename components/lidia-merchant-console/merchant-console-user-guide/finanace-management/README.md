# Finanace Management

The Finance Management section is the financial management area where sellers can track earnings, deductions, and payment processes related to their sales on the platform end to end. This section, specifically designed for the seller panel, allows sellers to transparently view how revenues are generated, which deductions are applied, and when net payment amounts will be transferred to their accounts. Through this area, sellers can analyze their company’s financial status, review past payments, and plan cash flow.
