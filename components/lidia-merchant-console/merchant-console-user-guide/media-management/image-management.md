# Image Management

Image Management is the main area where all visuals in the system are centrally collected and managed. This structure offers a folder-based organization that operates similarly to a file explorer on a computer. Grouping images through folders facilitates product-, category-, and brand-based media management and provides quick and organized access to content.

Through this section, sellers can manage the images used in product listing and update processes from a single central location, preventing repetitive upload operations and simplifying operational workflows. The folder structure provides order and control in content management, especially for sellers with a high volume of visual assets.

You can upload content in the following formats to this area:&#x20;

`.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .jfif, .webp, .rar, .zip`

Uploaded files can be filtered by file name, file type, file size, upload date, and last modified date. This advanced filtering structure offers a fast and efficient management experience for sellers with extensive media content.
