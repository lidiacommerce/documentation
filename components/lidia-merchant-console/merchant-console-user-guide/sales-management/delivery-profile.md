# Delivery Profile

The Delivery Profiles section is where sellers manage which shipping companies their products will be sent with and in which priority order. This section enables the standardization of delivery processes, increases operational efficiency, and allows centralized management of shipping operations.

The Delivery Profiles screen consists of two main tabs:\
Delivery Profiles and Shipping Costs.

### **Delivery Profiles**



1.  #### **Standard Profiles**

    Standard profiles are system-provided profiles that include shipping options contracted with integrated marketplaces for sellers who want to ship their products via cargo. These profiles are part of a centrally managed structure provided by the system.

    The definition and management of standard profiles are handled through the **Marketplace Console →** [**Settings**](../../../lidia-console/lidia-console-user-guide/settings.md) **→ Logistics → Profiles** page. Lidia provides the marketplace admin with the ability to manage profile structures by prioritizing shipping providers under small cargo and large cargo categories according to preference. This allows the logistics strategy to be centrally controlled.

    On the Merchant Console side, sellers can view these profiles on the Delivery Profiles page under the Standard Profiles heading. Each profile is displayed with the following information:\
    profile type, creation date, last updated date, and status.

    When navigating to the details of a standard profile, sellers can see which contracted shipping companies are prioritized for small and large cargo shipments. This structure allows sellers to clearly understand which shipping provider will be used during the delivery process.
2.  #### **Custom Profiles**

    Under the Custom Profiles section, which is separate from standard profiles, all shipping companies that sellers or dealers have contracted with and defined in the system are listed.

    In this area, sellers can:

    * Define a delivery profile name,
    * Adjust the priority order for small and large cargo,
    * Create custom delivery profiles tailored to their operational needs.

    This structure provides flexibility for sellers and enables customized shipping management for different product types or logistics scenarios.

### Shipping Costs

The Shipping Costs tab displays the cargo fees (₺) of shipping companies based on desi / kg. The table shown on this page can be exported and downloaded in Excel format using the Export Data option. The prices shown on this screen are for informational purposes only and exclude VAT, taxes, and additional fees.

When a shipping company is changed on an order basis, billing is carried out according to the price list of the shipping company from which the shipment is dispatched.

All informational warnings related to shipping costs are displayed on this screen, ensuring sellers are informed in advance about potential additional charges.

* #### **Additional Charges**

In addition to standard shipping fees, additional charges may occur in the following situations:

* **Out-of-Zone Delivery=** Additional costs incurred for deliveries made to recipient addresses that are outside the distribution area of the relevant shipping or logistics company.
* **Re-dispatch=** Additional costs incurred when shipments that could not be delivered to the recipient are sent out for delivery a second time by the shipping or logistics company. These costs are billed to the seller.
* **Failed Delivery=** Additional costs incurred when shipments that could not be delivered to the customer are returned to the seller by the shipping or logistics company. These costs are billed to the seller.
* **Other Additional Costs=** Additional costs that may occur outside of the situations listed in the table (such as package splitting or additional personnel support for floor delivery) are also billed to the seller as invoiced by the shipping companies.
