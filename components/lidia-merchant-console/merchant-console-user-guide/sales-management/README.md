# Sales Management

The Sales Management section is the main operational area where sellers manage paid orders, delivery processes related to orders, invoice upload steps, and financial breakdowns. This section ensures that the entire process—from order creation to delivery completion—is managed in a controlled, traceable, and well-documented manner.

Sales Management is structured under the headings Order Management, Delivery Management, Delivery Profile, and Request Management. Through these headings, sellers can view the orders assigned to them in detail, track order statuses, and manage operational steps related to the delivery process.

Within the scope of Order Management, the status of paid orders can be monitored; order items, customer information, and financial details related to the order can be viewed. While cargo and delivery processes are tracked through the Delivery Management area, delivery-related configurations and definitions are managed under the Delivery Profile heading.

Request Management enables sellers to review and resolve customer requests such as cancellations, returns, or exchanges that may occur after an order is placed. In this way, post-sales processes are managed within a centralized and consistent structure.

The Sales Management section plays a critical role in enabling sellers to effectively manage both their operational and financial processes from a single central point.
