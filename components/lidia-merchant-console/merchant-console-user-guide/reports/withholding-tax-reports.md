# Withholding Tax Reports

The Withholding Tax Report is a reporting area where sellers can view the statutory withholding tax deductions applied to their sales transactions on a periodic basis. The purpose of this report is to clearly and transparently present which withholding tax rate was applied in which period, how this deduction was calculated based on the transaction amount excluding VAT, and the final withheld tax amount. The Withholding Tax Report is available in the system to help sellers accurately track their legal obligations, manage accounting and audit processes effectively, and clearly analyze the relationship between income and deductions.

#### **Report Content**

In the withholding tax report, the following information is provided for each period:

* Period information
* Applied withholding tax rate (%)
* Transaction amount excluding VAT
* Withheld tax amount

Sellers can view a detailed report separately for each period. The period-based detailed view allows sellers to examine which transactions the withholding tax calculation is based on and which rates were applied.

In the periodic withholding tax report, detailed transaction information related to the withholding tax deduction is provided. Within this scope, the report includes the following details:

Intermediary company information:\
Tax Office, Tax Identification Number, Company Name, Address (TR)

Information of the company on whose behalf the withholding tax is deducted

Transaction details:\

This detailed structure enables sellers to clearly see between which parties and as a result of which transactions the withholding tax deductions occurred.
