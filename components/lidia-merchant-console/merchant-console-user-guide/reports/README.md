# Reports

The Reports section is a centralized reporting area where sellers can monitor, analyze, and evaluate all their operations on the platform in a data-driven manner. This section consists of different report types, including Sales Reports, Cancellation/Return Reports, Product Reports, and Withholding Tax Reports, providing sellers with a comprehensive view of both their operational and financial processes.

Reporting enables sellers to regularly track sales performance, identify product-level successes and areas for improvement, and analyze cancellation and return rates to take operational actions. At the same time, financial reports allow sellers to review their revenues, deductions, and legal obligations in a transparent and detailed way.

The reports provided in this section support sellers in making strategic decisions, increasing operational efficiency, and sustainably managing their performance on the platform.
