# Sales Reports

Sales Reports are the main reporting area where detailed information for all sales carried out by the seller is available. This section allows sales to be analyzed in both summary and detailed views and enables sellers to evaluate their sales performance across different dimensions.

Under this heading, sellers are first presented with a chart showing the sales amount and the number of products sold by date. Using the date range filter on the chart, the desired period can be selected. When a date filter is applied, the sales detail list displayed below the chart is filtered simultaneously.

Thanks to this synchronized structure, sellers can evaluate their sales performance for a specific period through both visual (chart) and tabular representations at the same time. This allows periodic sales trends as well as increases or decreases to be analyzed quickly and clearly.

#### Sales Detail List

Directly below the chart, there is a comprehensive and detailed order list related to sales. Through this list, sellers can examine each order in detail on a single screen. The information displayed in the list includes:

* Customer first and last name
* The total number of orders the customer has placed to date
* Category and brand information of the products included in the order
* The product or products included in the order
* The address from which the order was placed
* Invoice type
* The shipping company used for the order and the shipping cost
* Shipping status
* Order date

This detailed structure allows sellers to analyze sales operations based on customer, product, and logistics dimensions.

When any order row listed in the sales report is selected, the seller is automatically redirected to the Sales Management → [Order Management ](../sales-management/order-management.md)page in the left menu, where the order detail screen for the selected order is displayed. All data listed in the sales reports can be exported and documented in Excel format using the Export Data option. This feature provides convenience for analyzing reports in external systems, archiving, and use in accounting processes.
