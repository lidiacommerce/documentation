# Order Management

## Overview

The **Order Management** system allows merchants to track and manage orders from receipt to fulfillment and return. Merchants can view all orders, update their statuses, and manage customer communications from a single interface. The system integrates with logistics providers for seamless shipping and delivery tracking.

## Key Features

* **Order Tracking**: Monitor orders at every stage (processing, shipped, delivered).
* **Shipping and Fulfillment**: Integrate with logistics providers for order fulfillment or manage manual shipments.
* **Returns and Refunds**: Process and manage returns and refunds with built-in tools.
