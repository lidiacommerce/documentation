# Settings

The **Settings** section contains pages where PIM users can configure and manage system-wide settings. These settings enable effective platform management and customization.

## **Authorization**

The **Authorization** section includes pages where user roles and permissions are defined and managed within the PIM system. It consists of two main categories:

* **Users**: The **Users** page displays a list of all registered users in the PIM system. Users can be viewed in detail, updated, deleted, and filtered based on their status.
* **Roles**: The **Roles** page lists predefined roles and the number of active users assigned to each role. New roles can be created, and existing roles, including admin roles, can be edited. Permissions for specific pages can also be adjusted, and inactive roles can be deleted.

## **Contacts**

The **Contacts** section allows listing and managing defined users within the PIM system. User details and access permissions can be modified from this section.

## **Catalog**

The **Catalog** menu includes pages used to organize, manage, and maintain product data.

* **Product Families**: The **Product Families** page is used to group products with similar characteristics. For example, an electronics store may create product families such as **"Phones"** or **"Computers"**.
* **Collections**: The **Collections** section allows users to view existing collections and create new ones.

### **Properties**

The **Properties** menu defines specific attributes for products, allowing for more detailed product descriptions. It is divided into two subsections:

* **Properties**: This page defines and manages product attributes such as **"128 GB Storage"** under **"Disk Capacity"**.
* **Property Groups**: **Property Groups** categorize similar properties, such as **"Technical Specifications"** or **"Dimensions,"** for better organization.

### **Options**

The **Options** menu manages additional product customizations and variations. It consists of three subsections:

* **Options**: The **Options** page defines product variations such as different colors or sizes.
* **Option Groups**: **Option Groups** categorize similar options, such as **"Colors"** or **"Sizes,"** for better management.
* **Option Value Groups**: **Option Value Groups** store possible values for a specific option. For example, the **"Colors"** group may contain values like **"Red,"** **"Blue,"** and **"Green."**

### **Data Locks**

The **Data Locks** page prevents accidental modifications of critical data, such as product information or pricing.

### **Product Relations**

**Product Relations** allow linking products to define different types of relationships, including:

* **Main and Sub-Product Relationship**
* **Related Product Relationship**
* **Accessory Product Relationship**

### **Category Dimensions**

**Category Dimensions** streamline product navigation within the PIM system by creating filters for product categories.

## **Channels**

In **PIM systems, Channels** define where product data is managed and made available for different sales platforms, marketplaces, e-commerce stores, retail locations, and social media platforms. **Channels** ensure that product data is correctly formatted, optimized, and distributed according to the specific requirements of each platform.

By using **Channels**, businesses can ensure that products are published with accurate and up-to-date information, improving customer experience and sales performance. **Channels** also enable product data tracking, updates, and reporting for each platform.

## **Tags**

**Tags** provide a centralized area where labels assigned to products, categories, brands, and lists are managed.

## **Localizations**

**Localization** refers to adapting products and services to specific markets or regions based on cultural, linguistic, and geographic factors. The **Localization** menu consists of four sections:

* **Multi-Language**: Languages can be centrally defined in the PIM system, allowing product data to be translated and managed in multiple languages.
* **Multi-Currencies**: Currency management ensures that product pricing lists are maintained in multiple currencies, with exchange rates managed centrally.
* **Units of Measures**: Measurement unit management allows products to have centrally managed dimensions and weight units, ensuring consistency across product data.
