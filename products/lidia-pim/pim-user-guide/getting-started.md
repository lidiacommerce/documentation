* **Product Families**: Organizes products into predefined groups based on shared attributes and characteristics, enabling efficient management of similar product types.
* **Data Pools**: Represents collections of product data that can be processed, enriched, and published to various channels. This section helps manage product information before it is distributed.
* **Categories**: Defines the hierarchical structure of the product catalog, allowing products to be organized into logical groups based on industry standards or company-specific classifications.
* **Custom Lists**: Allows users to create and manage personalized product groupings based on specific criteria, enabling better segmentation and filtering of product data.
* **Trademarks**: Manages registered brand names and logos associated with products, ensuring accurate brand representation across various sales and marketing channels.
* **Channels and Feeds**: Handles the distribution of product data to external platforms such as e-commerce websites, marketplaces, and other third-party systems. Users can configure channels and set up feeds to automate data exports.
