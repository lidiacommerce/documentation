#### Product History

With the rise of the Internet in the 2000s, businesses began to use the web as an active sales and marketing channel, which highlighted the need for enriched product data. While ERP systems initially managed product data, the increasing demand for high-resolution images, product videos, and detailed descriptions for online sales surpassed the capabilities of these traditional systems. This need led to the development of specialized PIM systems, and Lidia PIM emerged as a solution to these challenges.

Development of Lidia PIM began in 2021 by T\&G Workshop, with its first alpha version released in mid-2022. The system was designed to address the modern needs of digital product data management, moving beyond the limitations of ERP systems by offering tools for product data enrichment, media management, and seamless data distribution across digital channels.

Product data can be imported into the Lidia PIM application by integration using the Lidia PIM API or by using Excel files.
