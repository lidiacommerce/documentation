# Lidia Commerce Engine

## What is a Headless Commerce Engine?

A headless commerce engine separates the front-end customer experience from the back-end business processes. This architecture allows businesses to deliver seamless and consistent shopping experiences across multiple channels—be it web, mobile, social media, or IoT devices—by decoupling the presentation layer from the commerce logic. Unlike traditional systems, headless commerce provides the flexibility to innovate rapidly, enhance user interfaces, and customize workflows without being constrained by back-end limitations. This approach enables organizations to create unique, tailored experiences while maintaining robust commerce capabilities on the back end.
