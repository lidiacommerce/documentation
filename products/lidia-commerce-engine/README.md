# Lidia Commerce Engine

## What is a Headless Commerce Engine?

A headless commerce engine separates the front-end customer experience from the back-end business processes. This architecture allows businesses to deliver seamless and consistent shopping experiences across multiple channels—be it web, mobile, social media, or IoT devices—by decoupling the presentation layer from the commerce logic. Unlike traditional systems, headless commerce provides the flexibility to innovate rapidly, enhance user interfaces, and customize workflows without being constrained by back-end limitations. This approach enables organizations to create unique, tailored experiences while maintaining robust commerce capabilities on the back end.

The **Headless, API-first, Micro-service Based Scalable Platform** **Lidia Commerce Engine** emphasizes flexibility, modularity, and scalability, supporting businesses to manage diverse digital commerce operations seamlessly. Here's how these features are reflected:

1. **Headless Architecture**: Lidia Commerce Engine is designed to be "headless," meaning the backend operations (like managing orders, inventory, etc.) are decoupled from the frontend presentation layer. This allows businesses to create custom user interfaces tailored to their needs, whether it's for a website, mobile app, or other digital touchpoints, without being restricted by the backend system​​.&#x20;
2. **API-First Approach**: Lidia Commerce Engine is built with an API-first approach, ensuring that all functionalities are accessible via well-documented, open APIs. This makes it easy to integrate with existing systems such as ERP, CRM, or PIM systems, and to extend capabilities with third-party services, including payment gateways and logistics providers. This API-first architecture supports businesses in building scalable, flexible ecosystems​​.
3. **Microservice-Based Platform**: The engine is composed of 18 distinct microservices (such as inventory, order, identity, and marketing), each handling specific tasks. This modular structure enhances scalability, maintainability, and flexibility, allowing businesses to scale individual services independently.&#x20;

The Lidia Commerce Engine offers flexible deployment options, allowing it to be run both in the cloud and on-premises. Here’s an overview of this capability:

1. **Cloud Deployment**:
   * Lidia Commerce Engine supports deployment on leading cloud platforms like **Amazon AWS**, **Microsoft Azure**, and **Huawei Cloud**. This allows businesses to leverage cloud scalability, cost-efficiency, and flexibility.
   * Cloud deployments are ideal for companies looking to scale quickly, manage infrastructure less directly, and utilize the built-in security and disaster recovery mechanisms provided by cloud vendors.
2. **On-Premises Deployment**:
   * For businesses that prefer or require data to be stored and managed in their own infrastructure due to regulatory, security, or legacy system integration needs, Lidia Commerce Engine can also be deployed on-premises.
   * This option provides more control over data and infrastructure and is particularly useful for organizations with strict compliance requirements or specific industry regulations.
3. **Platform Flexibility**:
   * Whether in the cloud or on-premises, Lidia Commerce Engine can run on **Kubernetes** or **Virtual Machines (VMs)**. This ensures that businesses can tailor the infrastructure based on their needs, whether they seek containerized environments for faster scaling or VM-based setups for stability and legacy system compatibility.

This flexibility in deployment allows Lidia Commerce Engine to adapt to various business environments, providing options for organizations with diverse infrastructure needs​​​.
