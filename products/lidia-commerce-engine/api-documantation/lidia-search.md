# Lidia Search

## **Overview**

**Lidia Search** is a powerful microservice within the Lidia Commerce Engine, designed to optimize product discovery and enhance the customer search experience on digital commerce platforms. It provides fast, accurate, and intelligent search capabilities, helping users find products, services, or content quickly, which ultimately improves engagement and conversion rates.

## Key Concepts

1. **Full-Text Search:** Lidia Search enables full-text search capabilities, allowing users to input keywords or phrases and receive relevant results. The service indexes all searchable content, including product descriptions, names, SKUs, and metadata, ensuring a comprehensive search experience.
2. **Search Filters and Facets:** The service supports the use of filters (e.g., price, category, brand) and facets, enabling customers to refine their search results based on specific criteria. This allows for more targeted product discovery, especially when browsing large catalogs with many product options.Explore Filters and Facets Setup
3. **Autocomplete and Suggestions:** As users type into the search bar, Lidia Search provides real-time autocomplete suggestions and popular search queries. This helps guide users to relevant results faster, improving the overall search experience and reducing the effort needed to find products.
4. **Synonyms and Misspellings Handling:** Lidia Search accounts for common typos, misspellings, and synonyms, ensuring that users still find the right products even if they donâ€™t spell or phrase their queries perfectly. For example, searching for "smartfone" will still return results for "smartphone."
5. **Personalized Search Results:** Lidia Search can deliver personalized search results based on user behavior, preferences, or past interactions. This means that customers are more likely to see results tailored to their interests, leading to increased relevance and a higher likelihood of conversion.
6. **Ranking and Relevance Tuning:** The service allows businesses to customize how search results are ranked. Product relevance can be fine-tuned based on factors like popularity, recency, availability, or business priorities (e.g., promoting high-margin products at the top of search results).
7. **Search Analytics and Insights:** Lidia Search provides insights into user behavior, such as popular search terms, search success rates, and queries that lead to no results. This helps businesses understand what customers are looking for, enabling them to optimize their product catalog and search functionality.

## Example

Suppose an online fashion retailer uses Lidia Search to improve the customer experience. When a customer types "red dress," the search service quickly provides autocomplete suggestions like "red summer dress" or "red cocktail dress." After submitting the search, the customer can refine their results by selecting filters like "size," "brand," or "price range." Even if the customer types "redd dress," Lidia Search will correct the query and show relevant products.

The retailer can also promote certain products, like highlighting new arrivals or best-selling dresses at the top of the results page, ensuring that important or high-margin items are easily discoverable.
